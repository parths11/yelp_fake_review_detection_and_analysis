39359,JKsgNf8k1-YVL-TlprqvsQ,"I am a huge oyster person, loved the hama hama it's clean, fresh, highly recommended, the walleye was so delicious.  We even tried one of their sushi rolls, not bad!  This is a must return to place.",N
64527,e5kAHSdPfanRedY9mV9Jrw,"Excellent!!!  Great food, reasonable price, and always good service.  If you go on a weekend you'll need to anticipate about a 30-40 min wait if you arrive after 9:30.  They're very good at estimating wait times and are always withing a couple minutes of what they tell you.  They also have validated parking next door for $7.",Y
11443,3DX7DAo8Hs4DGIJY6tnj1w,"BEAUTIFUL patio outside!!  The location is so random.  Food was pretty good, not amazing.  Wine was great, and even cheap wine tastes good after it breathes for 20 minutes, or after a glass or so when you don't care as much.  Service initially seemed a little rushed but eventually matched our pace, which was slower when we went.  We only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table without a reservation which was nice.  However it was a little hard to get bar service.  But our cocktails were really really good!  Overall a nice place for a summer night.",N
38757,HH3wTL0t98M9ZZEKtKKF1Q,"I have been to Shaw's a few times over the years and recently celebrated my Boy Toys Birthday here.  It is his favorite restaurant in Chicago. I had only ever eaten in the casual bar area before, and this time we ate in the dining room.  On a Tuesday evening, it was noisy and bustling.  Perfect for the occasion!  The service was absolutely top notch.  We had oysters to start and a bottle of wine.  I had the salmon, my date had the crab.  I don't remember the dessert, because at that point we were finishing off our second bottle of wine.  I do remember that overall, my experience was wonderful! This is a great place to go with out-of-towners or business Associates.  It is a great place for a Birthday celebration or to celebrate a promotion.",N
45782,4sGk0iD67IMVRmG,Fast service and awesome food.  Burrata cheese and heirloom tomatoes on toast makes the best bruschetta I have ever had.,N
21618,Pn5MdxWOBNEwmTqIq4MXhQ,"This is my favorite sushi joint.  And it's BYOB, which always wins points in my book.  I have never had anything from here that was sub-par.   Often they have fatty toro, fatty hamachi or fatty salmon.  All of these things are incredible.  Their oysters are delicious.  I always want more of their ginger salad.  Their specials are always interesting.  I'm never afraid of trying something new here.   And you can eat and eat and eat and eat and you won't spend a ton of money.  Now, keep in mind, that any good sushi is somewhat pricey; however, the quality is supurb. And it's worth the amount on your check.  I even got my husband liking sushi by taking him here.  I call that a win for me.   I recommend a reservation because they get pretty busy.",N
55902,O6g4XEifvYDUTH1m1fOUnQ,"I've now been to Big Jones twice and have sampled their brunch AND their dinner. Man, this is one of my new favorite places! My brunch (which was months ago) was delicious - I had  the Cajun Pancakes and my friend had an omelette. The topper? for dessert we had the ""personal size red velvet cake"". They bake them one at a time and you have to give them about 15 minutes notice. Delicious. On that delicious meal, I chose Big Jones to bring an out of town friend. This time, I was trying the dinner. Just wonderful - great service, great food. I'll defintely be back.",N
39517,3wqEMXZWjtv7sOUNPfpLiw,"I love Meli..really really love it. Everything about their food tastes so delicious!! I always order something with their organic eggs mostly because I can actually taste the fluffy creaminess of them. Yum Yum Yum! I love their corn beef hash, which I always find myself ordering. But their sweet breakfast items are more than lip smacking! My absolute fav is their nutella crepe with fresh bananas. They're amazing! I do admit that they use a bit too much nutella, but who cares!! They're worth it. My dad who isn't a breakfast nut by any means can not get enough of their granola, which I always have to order a bag of to go. :) They prepare and make it in-house and it's the perfect mixture of granola, flax seeds, and dried fruit. I think the best I've ever tried to be honest! Meli is definitely the place to go for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. In fact, if they were open for dinner, I'd go there too. :) This location is definitely the place to be at. I was not a fan of their downtown location.",N
53548,0yGCpB0ZG2Z,"I like. As far as the place and the food is concerned, I think a 4 is appropriate. To be fair, I did have high expectation b/c of its ""sister"" restaurants, avec and blackbird, both of which-esp. avec--are better. However, I really liked the service, and that's the icing. I just went there for my husband's birthday, and apparently the server (the guy w/dreads) overheard us say something about his birthday and put a lit candle on our dessert (so sweet!). We also tried a lot of things and had changes yet he remembered everything w/out us even repeating it (though he had about 4 words on his pad). Anyway, the inside is pretty cool. They probably chopped down a forest to fashion this restaurant, but I still like it. LOVED the char on bread, my fries were just ok (but I guess you can only expect so much from fries, the mussels were pretty good (though the sauce they were served in was delicious and they gave you break to soak it up), and, what I waited for the entire night, the dessert waffle w/blueberries and honey butter (that's not completely true, I wanted the eclair but it was my husband's bday so he got to choose)was...meh. I would have given the place a 9 (I wish yelp started doing things out of 10), but I'm rounding up.",N
13138,09ldgYD5pZcvKfmZzFhlGQ,"Finally had the chance to eat at Piece since the wait was only 20 minutes at 6:00pm on a Saturday. The place was crowded but I am sure it gets much worse the later it gets. We ordered a large with sausage, tomato, and green peppers. The pizza was big enough for 4 of us except we split a couple of salads to start. The pizza was good but not great. The beer was good. The atmosphere was good. The only thing that is not good is how crowded it is all the time.",N
14284,MZBuJtXetkC9EjoFXdj16A,"I want to give this place a higher review but I'm so sad I can't :(. They used to have my favorite mojitos in the city but recently something has changed and they aren't any good. Sooo disappointing. But I still rate it pretty highly because their brunch breakfast burritos make me insanely happy. I vote best I've ever had. Their taste of Cuba platter is so delicious!! It's a must if you go.  So I hate to do this AGAIN but I have to drop my rating.  We went, we were ignored by the host for like 15 minutes and then finally seated.  Our food came and 2 out of the 3 orders were incorrect (not just like one thing here or there but the major things wrong.)  and it was awful.  Sad face.  Used to be my go to for brunch but no longer.",N
11042,MARyaGqQzrzL5fPW,"My first intro to Piece a couple of months ago was via delivery. We ordered a red thin crust sausage and cheese. It was very good, but I knew I would have to have an actual in restaurant experience. Decided to stop in a couple of weeks ago as I was in the area. It was crowded as hell in this joint! My party of 3 was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait..we were seated in 5 mins. We ordered a red thin cheese and pepperoni which was very good. They have a very good beer selection as I went with the camel's toe (for obvious reasons...lol) which was a pretty good beer. Sad I am just now checking this joint out as I once lived nearby. Good stuff here and will pay more visits.",N
15682,6f2JWC3KCDZXRJAis0503g,"I really wanted to love this place because I have a friend who rants and raves...but not so much.   Ordered soup...got through 2 slow rounds of drinks before we had to ask about it.  Our waiter then was like ""oh, sorry.  Yeah about the soup.  We are out of the soup of the day and I was meaning to ask you if roasted red pepper and tomato soup is ok"" Yeah sure, fine.  I'm starving, bring me whatever! Soup took another 15 minutes to get to the table.  It was delicious, but that was the highlight of the meal.   It took another 45 minutes AFTER the delayed soup to get our fish.  The server actually came out to tell us that our food was on the line under the heaters waiting for a runner and he was sorry it was taking so long.  If you have the time to see the food and come outside and tell us it was ready then why wouldn't you just bring it out???  It took another 10 minutes for them to bring it out.  Mine was very fishy, my boyfriends was very dry, his mom's fish had NO flavor at all, and his dad ordered chicken and ate about 1/3 of it.  It was served with a side of mac and cheese that he took one bite out of.  It was just horrible and the server knew it was bad.  He never asked us how our food was, and if we hadn't waited over an hour and half for the food we would have sent every dish back.  We were starving and none of us finished our plate, and we are all big clean plate people!   I would have given them 2 more stars had they discounted the bill.  But $200 for a knowingly shitty meal...not ok in my book.  I will NOT be back for dinner.  Sorry guys!",N
34077,cfxZZDVQheN-tnmXl45lVg,"Wow. Just, wow. Everything about this place is simply stellar, from the decor to the menu to the sushi bar. It's chic and modern but accented with old, historic pieces that are influenced by Asian design--I loved the whole concept. And as for the food--I think ""yum"" sums it up. We went for brunch, which has quite the reputation, and it lived up to all the hype. The bloody mary bar alone took our breath away; every garnish you could ever imagine! My girlfriend got the ""Hangover Cure"" and I got the Oxtail Smash. Both were probably the most unattractive combination of foods--eggs, rice, potatoes, hamburger patty--but platted oh-so-nicely. And we weren't complaining because we were too busy shoveling the goodness into our mouths. Then cookie bites for dessert. Love. The service was fantastic. Very genuine and not snobby at all; I won't lie, we were worried about how intimidating this place might be. Not at all. We didn't even get to the sushi portion of the menu. You can bet we'll be sampling that on  our second visit. Highly recommend.",N
13076,Ms1bLefrdMWnx6kt3nZXjQ,"This place is awesome.  I have been more than 10 times and I always get the same thing.. start with the awesome mixed greens salad (order a small for 2 people, or a large for more than that), and you will LOVE it!!  The dressing is light, and there are even candied walnuts. Fabulous!  My go-to pizza choice is pepperoni with banana peppers.  It is so so so good.  Last week, I went and had my classic, and then tried a new one (shock!) which was also great.  We got goat cheese, sausage and mushroom.  The goat cheese was so good on a pizza.  The place almost always has a wait... but the beers are so good, who cares!?  It is a great place for a group or a date, if you're sure you like the person!  If not, it could be a long night if it's busy!",N
9985,TmxGU6dhkKDREXpGsBDJaQ,"I love the fact that they bring warm bread and feta cheese out to every table. I have been here a few times and it is funny, I always seem to have the same waitress (I wish I had her name to compliment her)...she is always very nice! The food here is great. We usually will get a chicken dish and a lamb dish. I tried the Lebanese white wine on the last trip and it was delicious! It might be one of my new favorites.",N
10791,s2P67DYYba5J8gyR-,"The concierge recommended Piccolo Sogno. I suggest you go there.  It's a huge value, just like eating in Rome, no lie. Big TIP: Pastas are available in appetizer sizes so go small plates! Piccolo Sogno delighted and amazed. The pastas are exotic, rich and right on, not too salty or over spiced. The wine selection, mostly Italian, features gems between $30-$70. The WHOLE tab for two (2 appetizers, 2 pastas, the amazing short rib entree, and two desserts ranged from excellent to stunning. Let them know you're doing a Yelp review. They took amazing care of us. Reports of service issues with Piccolo Sogno don't jive with what we experienced. There were groups of young men hanging out, barely letting a crumb hit the table.",N
52497,cDDD8QYSPzk0iAMOTMS26g,It's a steakhouse restaurant with adjacent lounge. The rooftop lounge area is not really grand but has intimate vibe to it. Very NoMi-esque. Judging from an interesting fireplace installation at the bottom floor it can be said that someone wanted an ambitious modern decor. I wish I could render similar verdict about their drinks. Very limited options of liquor. Managers should really diversify their bar if they still wish to attract crowd into their lounge.,N
8695,yVnWIhHeCzBiMywShkoMfw,"meh. this was ok.  we started with fried zucchini and capresse salad for appy's - the zucchini was too sweet for my taste and the capresse was really good.  Then came two pizzas, a white with truffles oil and mushrooms and a red with buffalo cheese and basil.  Eh.  It was good.  In my opinion, good, but not outstanding.  Plus it all tended to slide off the crust before it got to your mouth, which was just sort of an annoyance.  I guess we were comparing to another Napoli pizza place we frequented near a class we were taking and that just blew me away.  This left me a little sad that I hadn't decided to return there instead of try a new place.  The tiramisu, however, was quite tasty.  And the service was quite good too.  I just can't give it more stars because the pizza itself was underwhelming, to me, but I'm far from an expert on Napoli pizza.",N
16853,r-VfAY-orChISn3HIUmBSw,"I was in Chicago for a girlfriends' weekend, and our cocktails at the Violet Hour were absolutely what we needed! One of my friends who is new to the city said she heard it was a great cocktail lounge, and once we got there, we knew it was perfect for what we wanted! It's luxurious, the drinks are delicious, the seating is quiet and private, the music is soothing and moody, the nibbles are tasty, and we were completely thrilled! Yes, some of the things the Yelpers write are true, though I don't think they were necessarily negatives. First, we didn't wait AT ALL. We arrived around 6 p.m. on a Thursday, and we got right in. Two of us were together, waiting on our third friend, and we stood outside for a bit because we didn't know if they would seat us if we weren't all there. But we were cold, and people kept going in, so we thought we better try or we might be waiting in a line; we went in and said there were two of us, and we would have a third, and they seated us immediately. We were given two of the very high-backed chairs (I loved those!) and an ottoman. We knew that our friend would probably not feel comfortable sitting on that ""footstool,"" so we asked if we could move to an empty booth, and the waitress said ""of course!"" immediately and helped us move. The booth was wonderful, and we felt as if we were in one of our living rooms all evening -- a living room with a hostess, a waitress and amazing cocktails! Second, the lounge is not marked outside. We were a little flustered when we arrived because we weren't sure where it was, but we were waiting for our friend and watched people go in, so, with the help of Google maps, we confirmed it was the right place. Third, other people on Yelp have complained that the Violet Hour doesn't allow for standing customers, and, honestly, I thought it was awesome! By the time we left, the place was full, but it never felt crowded or irritating. I appreciate that the hosts/hostesses keep the numbers down to preserve the experience for those who are seated. If you want to go, try to go early on an off night, as we did, and you'll get to enjoy it. The lounge doesn't allow cell phone use, and we took this so seriously, we texted from inside our purses! But, again, I really appreciated that some Loudy Louderson wasn't screaming into his/her phone at the next table over. Finally, we all really liked the music! When we arrived, an older Rufus Wainwright album was playing, and my friend was thrilled with it, as was I. I found the music to be conducive to our conversation and enjoyment, not replacing it. What did we have? I stuck with the Juliet and Romeo all evening. It tastes like summer, and I just loved it, and didn't want to switch. It arrived in a champagne glass with a tiny carafe on the side with the ""rest"" of the drink, which I appreciated (these were not cheap!). My friend sampled more of the menu. They tried the raspberry cobbler, the Austin and  Pimm's traditional cocktail. The waitress worked with my friend and suggested things based on what she said she liked. We all liked all of our drinks, every single time. I also ordered food, the crispy pork belly and the goat cheese, and it was PLENTY. I shared and still couldn't eat it all. The pork belly was like ""pork belly nuggets,"" crispy on the outside and melty-tender on the inside. The ""dip"" was creme fraiche, and was amazing. The cheese came with PLENTY of bread and a fruit spread as well, and the prices for the food were reasonable. The only quibble I have/agree with is that they will NOT make you a standard cocktail. They will ONLY make the cocktails on the list, or, I guess, alternatives from their repertoire. My friend, after trying a couple of the menu items wanted a pomegranate martini, and the waitress said, ""we don't have that."" I think if you have a full bar, you can probably make a martini! That written, the cocktails we had were absolutely delicious! Honestly, our experience was nearly perfect, from the greeting at the door, the service (from many people, the hostess, who checked on us multiple time, to the waitress, to the runners who brought drinks and food). The ambience and decor, the privacy of the setting, the luxuriousness of the decor, the pleasantness of the music, the secluded feeling of the whole setting. I would absolutely go back to the Violet Hour next time I'm in Chicago. I've had lovely times at the SoHo Grand and the Brandy Library in New York City, and this definitely rivals those experiences.",N
18331,ra1O6HD6FxlT-aCv9ZuLxw,"I went with a friend who lives a few blocks away. I had not heard of it before, but was I impressed. From the moment I walked in...WOW. The decor is amazing. The host and hostess are both super friendly. Get there early to avoid a line. The front room and middle room are my two favorites. The servers are also knowledgeable and friendly. The drinks are amazing (try the Juliet & Romeo) and I feel as if I've walked into a more romantic and simpler time. I've been 4 times and will continue to bring friends to this exceptional place.",N
32765,0jBVC,"I'm a VERY picky fan of Chicken Pad Thai and this place is now neck and neck with Duck Walk on Fullerton for my favorite pad thai in the city!!  :)   Love it!  It's just the flavor I'm looking for when it comes to Chicken Pad Thai.  It has the thinner noodles, but it is still full of a subtle yet delicious flavor that I love and not brown or orangey looking like the kind of pad thai I loathe.  Chicken itself was good quality too. We also had the Crab Rangoons, yum, and the cold Peanut Spring Rolls which were also pretty good. Service was friendly and attentive.  Atmosphere is very busy and crowded so probably best for a dinner with friends or just a casual date where you don't want quiet.  The place is broken up into 3 different rooms to eat in but just know that it is tiny-ish, and the decor is cute too!  Just a nice warm place.",N
49077,QtbTFuFCIIJ52W-QoVbmlA,"Dude I was in Chicago for only like 5 days.  I went to a couple pizza joints and this place was the illest!   We had the most rad righteous pizza here, all you haters, come on now, just cause you had to wait long don't got nothin' on the pizza!   The feelin' was there, the vibe was fun and crowded and the pizza was on point for sure.  The deep dish....oh their deep dish, I guess I could go on and on about how it saved my life but you are just gonna have to check in. I spec the locals know a thing or two aboot pizza, but for us out-of-townies Giordano's is like finding a suit case full of money in a ditch near your house.",N

32571,2Yv7lcpLFRycLdmA7vShdw,"Yuck, the food was gross. The cheese on the cheesy bread was rubbery and smelled terrible. I added a star because I feel bad that I seemingly offended the staff when they overheard me complaining about the unappealing food.",N
28082,TpXTQJ8d-uiUODEa82eJpw,"Very Very nice place to take that special someone. We went there for my honey's birthday dinner. Food and wine was wonderful, better yet a 60%off Groupon Coupon is so worth it because they are a little pricey. Definitely a special place to impress :) Start off with Cheese Fondue, Main Course and my FAVORITE! Chocolate Fondue that is awesomest to my tummy.",N
28138,V2O2P60-li1VfhtG-t-PnA,"Mehhh.....maybe I'm just not a fondue person?  Sure, it was romantic, but I feel as though the main course lacked flavor and the dipping sauces were mediocre at best.  Especially for the dinner being $60 a person, which didn't include our drinks, I thought it was rather expensive and the portions were small for the prices.  Your clothes do smell like grease and when your meats slide off and splash into your oil, consider your favorite, fancy shirt stained.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the chocolate fondue with strawberries and marshmallows, but that's about it...Sorry Geja's...",N
27078,H8VETGXR8h1tWZSBLv2G-Q,"This place was good.  Tried some empanadas and garlic tostones/plantains.  The empanadas were decent, but my tostones were way, WAY too garlicky (and by the way, I love my garlic!).  Otherwise, the menu seemed to have a very good selection and the outdoor patio seating was a plus.  Also, make sure you bring cash, this place does not except credit/debit.",N

28114,fZpVkd9t0iSsDHQMvRdy4A,"One random Saturday afternoon Aaron picked up our food network magazine to see a spread about the fifty states and the best pizza in each one, we decided to see for ourselves if this place could beat out Uno;s and Lou's. It's a divey dark, kinda small but with a second floor kind of bar setting place. The waitstaff adorn shirts of the mascot which is a whale with a pair of panties on it's head. I couldn't figure out what the joke was there, but ah well. Everyone was friendly enough. Aaron and I decided to order up a deep dish pepperoni pizza and the fried appetizer platter. The timing was good because the appetizer came out fairly quickly. Everything on it was good, the stand out though, were the Jalapeno poppers. They had cheddar cheese in the middle rather than the more standard cream cheese. It was a really nice and tasty touch. The pizza was also fantastic. I loved the touch of the burnt parm cheese cooked on top of the crust. It was also a very balanced za just the right amount of sauce and cheese on it. The dough had almost an olive oil taste to it, and I swear that the sauce had a touch of red wine in it. The pep[eroni was nice and crisp and thin sliced with a hint of spice in it. All in all it was a great dinner. I keep telling Aaron that we need to make a return trip because that za was crave worthy.",N
61252,vgAY4YpPVa4DyxYI0OrqqQ,"I went there recently for the lunch buffet with a friend.  We haven't had breakfast, spent the morning walking around in the snow, and was reasonably hungry.  We were also looking for a good meal that will fill two healthy adult men, and came to India House.Soon as we sat down, we were served some garlic naan and tandoori chicken that was served on a sizzling platter.  Which was gooood!  The waiter asked if we would like some more, but we opted to try the buffet.  From my memory I remember about 12 or more entree options, with stir fried veggies and at least two different rice dishes, one being plain white.  I've been to maybe two different Indian lunch buffets in my life, but this is easily the best in terms of quality and quantity.  They also have a good salad/fruits selection and some tasty dessert menus, which included an amazing mango ice cream.The interior is surprisingly spacious, clean and some interesting decor, and the staff were very nice and ready to serve.  The location is a couple of blocks away from the Grand/State on the Red line.For a lunch buffet under the $20 price range, this is the Indian buffet to go!",Y
10041,10o4-nfSE4PjjwgftLCLcQ,"Chicago - Wednesday, December 9th 2009. 1:45pm. Snow flakes drifting on the city, wind blowing. I enter Le Colonial and everything is suddenly different. The temperature, the place, the time. It has been said times and times again but as soon as you push the door you find yourself transported in Saigon circa 1920. I fell in love with Vietnam through the screen; the movie 'Indochine' (a French one, and kinda of a chick flick even though it's supposed to be historical) showed off the country in the most beautiful way - and I discovered the Halong Bay. Instant love. Now my good friend Lili and her gorgeous Eurasian baby live over there and I cannot wait to go and see them. But in the meantime - there are some little bouts of paradise I can grab here and there. So far I was satisfied with getting pho and egg rolls on Argyle but now that I set foot in Le Colonial it may be hard to go back to ordinary.... The food was delicious - crisp flavors, fresh ingredients, wonderful combinations.... We shared the Cha Gio (what you guys would call 'egg rolls' but that are labeled as 'crispy spring rolls or shrimp pork and mushrooms - highly reminiscent of nems), Goi Cuon (spring rolls), Banh Cuon (the most delicious steamed chicken ravioli I have ever encountered in my life), Bo Luc Lac (filet mignon salad) and Bun Thit Nuong (barbecued pork served over noodles). Everything was p-e-r-f-e-c-t. Lovely banana desserts and great Graves wine. For a long and comfortable 2 hours, it wasn't winter anymore..... Pure magic.",N
57979,YsYBsGh,If you enjoy steak this place is for you! The waiters are great and the atmosphere is awesome! Just make sure you do not make any plans after dinner as a food coma follow along with the need to unbutton the pants and sit on the couch is promise! Great time!,N
38275,tVtcg3bSZyrArDe9B6KVZA,I really really like falafel. If there weren't so many hipsters here it would probably get five stars.,N
40796,2QA7NkUbN2UI6stGnPpdLw,"Yeah, I'd definitely compare this place to Dean & Deluca out in NYC. It's the premier selection of hard to find groceries. By the time you're done reading this, I hope you can guess what their deli counter is like, but let's just review a few of the finer points of their supplies as a grocer. 1. Mushrooms. There are so many varieties of edible mushrooms and at any major supermarket, you only have about 3. This place stocks all the ones you can't find or even heard about. Live beyond portabellos, criminis, and whites, and you will be greatly rewarded. 2. Olive oil. They stock olive oil like liquor stores stock beer. You would never believe just how many varieties are being produced and how they are appraised like wine. More importantly, you would never think that olive oil would make such a cool translucent wall display. 3. Dry pasta. Fresh pasta is overrated if you ask me because a properly made dry pasta is killer. Their pasta come from makers that use the best semolina and bronze dies! BRONZE dies are what makes the pasta. Most pasta makers use steel because they won't wear down, but bronze leaves the pasta scaly so it catches more sauce. 4. Olive bar. Did you know that there are over 20 different types of olives? I knew that,  and I'm sure you did too, but it's another thing entirely to be looking at an olive bar with 20 different types of olives. I've blown $40 just on olives because they are that good. Lovers of dirty martinis rejoice, because you have found your salvation from mail-order. 5. Cheese and crackers. While a place like Whole Foods provides an excellent assortment of cheese, this place has a cracker that compliments each cheese in addition to wine. I love crackers. I'm not even tackling spices and chocolates because those items can be procured elsewhere, but we're talking the convenience of localized concentration. I defy you to find me a store with this much variety of things most grocers overlook in one spot. It also means your bill will be about double or triple more than Jewel's or Dominicks.",N
28453,4u-mYKOJ7dgOrUbGTtctkQ,"I like Geja's even though you don't have a choice of broth/oil for the main fondue course. Even when it is so dark you can barely see your date let alone what you're eating. However, I am a bit perturbed by their Valentine's Day package. You MUST get the package deal to eat there on Friday or Saturday. A friend and I want to go, but we are vegetarian. Why do I have to pay exactly the same amount as people who will be getting more? Not very accommodating.",N
31881,6fv4yPN9J,"This place has been around FOREVER, and I really mean it. My earliest memory of this restaurant is eating here as a very young child with my parents. I am now 24 and my parents have been divorced for 15 years, so that definitely dates this memory. Anywho, on to the review. The food is your standard Thai fare: appetizers, noodle and rice dishes, and dishes based around meat, meat, and more meat. The food is prepared very quickly and it is fresh and tasty... yum. A couple of negatives (even if it is a 5-star review): Their meat dishes don't have a lot of vegetables in them. ""Why is this a complaint?"" you ask. Because sometimes I want a combination of veggies and not just two chunks of broccoli and beef. I know, call me crazy. Second, their waiters can have attitudes. Why the attitude my friend? I'm only trying to eat some of your delicious food. Prices are great, parking is very easy, and the ambiance is pretty decent if you go into one of the back rooms. The front room has a lot of foot traffic.

I ordered a stuffed pizza w/ italian sausage from here and I must say it made me a huge fan.  I wouldn't go as far to say that this is the best pizza place in Chicago, but I certainly like it.  Everyone has their own opinions on what great pizza is - this worked for me in particular.

Came back on a weekday with reservations and got seated within 10 minutes of checking-in - yay! They have a lunch prix fixe menu but not everything on the lunch menu was included. We thought that we can just pick 1 item from the appetizer, entree and dessert list but we assumed wrong - the choices were limited and not that enticing. We ordered from the regular menu instead and the food was good. We had Shrimp and Grits and Eggs New Orleans. My shrimp and grits were good but I was still hungry after - their portions were small for $13. The shrimps were a tad small, which was fine if they had given me more, but they didn't - I think there were only 6. Eggs New Orleans was delicious, but I thought the crab cakes were a bit dry. For $16, I was expecting it to be bigger as well (maybe we're just fatties?? I don't know) 3 stars because as much as the food was good, I thought it was pricey and not worth the wait.

The garlic mashed potatoes, au gratin potatoes, shoestrings and au gratin broccoli are all fabulous too. Their desserts are to die for. I always leave uncomfortably full because I cannot stop eating when I'm here. One time when I was here, I had a taste for Mike's Hard Lemonade and asked the waitress if they served it. She apologized and said no, so I ordered something different. Minutes later, she showed up at the table with a bottle of Mike's Hard Lemonade! She sent a staff member to the nearby liquor store to buy it for me! Everyone here consistently goes above and beyond and it does not go unnoticed.

I was worried after a bunch of rounds of phone tag and telephone with the staff that Duckmas might not happen, but it was all sorted out and ran smoothly on the big day. If you want the Beijing Duck Feast then you MUST call ahead and place an order. Their website says it takes them about 24 hours to prepare, so don't just show up expecting duck to magically appear. Not even on Christmas. They also say that a single duck dinner feeds 4-5 people. We had exactly 12 guests at our giant table and ordered 3 Duck Feasts. It was the perfect amount, but 2 people did not eat duck and ordered something else. We also ordered a couple sides of veggies and extra buns. Sun Wah is still BYOB even though they also have a liquor license and sell drinks. Corkage fee is $5 per bottle of wine. With all the food + corkage each person paid $18 for a ginormous meal.

65947,vfo_v1FXSxz7W112mNDXuA,"I would've say I love Anteprima, but I also don't hate it either. Some of the positives about it are that is a cute, quaint, bistro style Italian place in the heart of Andersonville. It isn't decorated over the top, and you almost feel like you are at someone's home for dinner. It's very charming and cute. The service has, for the most part, always been spot on minus one woman I had almost a year ago who talked to me and my date for almost 45 minutes about her life problems. The outdoor seating on the patio is beautiful and coveted during the Summer months. As for the menu, I want to preface this by saying that I am very well versed in different food ingredients and styles. Yet, even I have a difficult time guiding through the menu at Anteprima. It's not that a unique ingredient is mixed into the menu options and descriptions. The description is completely saturated in near hieroglyphics regarding what the ingredients are and how it's prepared. It almost makes you wonder if you're the only stupid person there who doesn't know what the hell the menu says, and if everyone else, like yourself, just pretends to order something they think they know and end up with a boar head sandwich! The wine list is the same format, all overwhelming and no tasting notes to help guide you through. As for the food, I have eaten here four times and every time, I have loved my appetizers and hated my entrees. The great appetziers include the antipasti selections with fig jam (yum), the dandelion fritters, and fried zucchini flowers. The entrees have always fallen short. I got the steak here one time that is supposed to be dressed with arugula and olive oil with lemon (as a garnish). Let me tell you, it was drenched in oil, almost as if a cup of oil was dumped on top of it.  It was inedible at almost $40. The salmon with lentils was blah. No seasoning or flavor. The fish of the day that they prepare in the philo dough was light, again lacking flavoring of the fish meat. The last time I had the duck with sage. Good, not great. If you go here, I would highly suggest ordering strictly from the appetizers and pastas selection, and skipping the entrees altogether. Not only will they add an additional $30-$40 to your bill, but they will leave you questioning the culinary integrity of this contemporary Italian spot. I certainly don't mind paying $150 for dinner, but blow me away!!",Y
47936,AUGSYbvOqWUVJJwuZK1Ylg,"Um..... (crickets) M&H has been so hyped up. I've tried to go numerous times, but have always found the long wait outweigh my desire to eat there. Well, I finally went, and was, sadly, completely unimpressed. There are a fair amount of lunch sandwiches, but like 7 breakfast options. There are also no breakfast potatoes, which I just find un-American. The breakfast panini comes with potato chips, but there are no hash browns, or anything like that. Ok, hash browns aren't so exciting, but nothing on their menu really was either. A lot of kids come here. And I'm fine with the stroller shuffle, and I get that kids are messy. But the table I was sat at clearly had a baby there prior to our seating. There was milk and cereal and general messiness all around the floor surrounding our table. I'd say I have an unusually high tolerance for filth, too, but in this case I was rather put off. But back to the beginning of my experience with M&H. They have you wait in line to order and a hostess finds a table for you to sit at either before or after you order, depending on when the tables become available. I've only experienced this system of seating at two other places - Xoco and Smoque. I think this system works very well at the aforementioned establishments, but at M&H I found it to be somehow obnoxious. I feel like when people go to Xoco or Smoque, they get their food, chow down and get out. If you have a coffee for brunch, I suspect you'll stay awhile and take your time, which leads to a back up of tables and many people who have ordered but are not yet seated and thusly have no where to really stand. In this case, it seems to be a really inefficient system. Actually, Xoco doesn't let you order until a table has been allocated. Perhaps you should take some notes from them, M&H. The coffee. To go it's cheap, but it's more expensive if you're eating in. That was just unfortunate, because I couldn't wait to get out of this crowded mess of a brunch restaurant, so I didn't even drink half a cup! Oh, Milk & Honey, I might be back, but probably not.",N

6420,Db3uIEuCARoqhOirY2Vy1g,"When my good friend announced we needed to go to Davanti because it was the best food he had ever had in Chicago, I was skeptical.  Don't get me wrong, I love Italian food as much as the next girl, but in my experience it rarely blows other eating experiences and cuisines out of the water.  I stand corrected. I have been to Davanti twice in a month and this coming from a girl who lives on the Northside and tries to check out new restaurants rather than doubling back.  This place is that good. One, the decor is lovely.  The back of the dining room is adorned with shelves and shelves of wine bottles and the bar area is lovely with nice blown glass-looking lights and walls decorated with wood from wine boxes.  It has a rustic Italian feel to it without being cheesy or over the top. The service is also good.  It's attentive and efficient, but without rushing you or being pushy. But the best, of course, is the food.  Both times we had the toasts with ricotta + honeycomb and roasted corn + walnuts + aged goat cheese + arugula + wild mushrooms salad, and both times, both were the highlights.  I love good cheese and I've eaten a lot of it, but this ricotta is fantastic.  It's so smooth, rich, and creamy.  I'm also not sure if it's the honey or if they add something to it, but it has a light flavor of fennel seed that is oh so delicious.  The corn salad is also spectacular.  It's a warm salad, which was perfect for the cool night we had it on, and so flavorful.  I love that the corn mixture and arugula were both separately dressed with different dressings so the mixture was layered with flavor. On one occasion we had the pizza della terra and the other the pizza della fattoria.  Both are fantastic, though the pizza della fattoria is quite rich thanks to the cheese, bechamel, egg, and pork belly so if you  order it you may want some lighter items to offset the richness.  The hanger steak and risotto are also fantastic, though the risotto again is a little on the rich side, though not excessively so. Both times we ended the night with the torta bacio which is ABSOLUTELY fantastic.  The chocolate-hazelnut mousse is incredibly light and chocolately.  I love that it managed to be decadent without being too rich or too sweet.  It was also perfectly contrasted against the crunchy bottom and the earthy cocoa nibs. All an all, this was a fantastic meal.  My only gripe is the $7 corkage fee for wines off their list.  I guess they include this because you can buy their wines to take home (and avoid the fee) but this is a little frustrating to me because since it's a flat fee and not a percentage it means that the price for the more affordable bottles goes way up, while it is pretty minimal on spendier bottles.  Yes, it's noted on the top of the menu, but I didn't see it and would guess most don't see it either.  I say just roll it into the price of your wine and give those who buy the wine to go a discount.  This policy sucks, but the restaurant itself is great.  Really hoping this practice/policy changes because everything else is spot on.  If you're going to charge $7/bottle corking fee no matter what it makes me want to bring my own.",N
38645,n0k34HTg7j-xKck4XjdOXA,"Our group of 5 dined here for their infamous Beijing duck dinner. I dutifully made our reservations and reserved the duck dinner for the table. Tuesday night at 630 and the place was pretty empty, but by 7pm it was starting to quickly fill up. Along with the duck dinner we ordered some Chinese Broccoli and a seafood dinner special.  Once all the food arrived at the table, it didn't look like there was going to be enough. But at the end of dinner, we were all satisfied and I was the lucky recipient of our duck leftovers. Leftovers! Our meal came to about $15 per person.  Not too shabby. The duck is delicious. It's a fatty fowl, but delicious and flavorful. The crispy skin adds some texture and crunch and is soooo worth the splurge.  The fluffy white buns you get to make little duck ""sammies"" with are wonderful.  It's like bao dough only BETTER. It's as good as my mom's siopao dough and that's saying a lot.  Add some daikon and plum sauce and it's a delectable treat.  The duck soup and the duck fried rice were just OK. I'd rather just eat more bao and duck sammies the next time I visit.  Or get the noodles--I've heard the duck and noodles are out of this world. Chinese Broccoli was very fresh, well steamed but not overdone at all.

It's a harsh start, but I wanted to end the review on a good note.  The greeter honored our reservation and we were seated immediately on the outdoor patio.  To start, the calamari was done well and the batter was not too heavy.  The funghi tartufati pizza was commendable.  But it was the pasta dishes that really won me over.  The stracci di farro was refreshing.  The pasta is made with imported farro flour and tossed with asparagus tips and mushrooms, then topped with truffle oil and parmesan curls.   The spaghetti nero ""frutti di marre"" was my favorite of the night.  The black spaghetti melded with the thick san marzano tomato sauce and there was just enough green chile to stimulate your palate with every bite.  Hidden throughout the dark strands were the array of fresh seafood.   As far as ambiance: Dining al fresco under the fig trees with a glimpse of the night sky was just sublime.  This experience ranks up there with the outdoor cabanas at Volo.  I guess this is as close to dining on the Italian countryside I can get for now...sigh*",N

You know, like it was your child and that he/she would become great when they grow up. However, my dreams were crushed when the Purple Pig turned out to be a tweaked out salt-addict. We basically ordered based on all the other wonderful yelp reviews. What we had: 1) Fried Pig Ears 2) Bone Marrow Spread 3) Blade Steak 4) Pork Shoulder with Mash 5) Turkey Leg Confit The fried pig ear and bone marrow was delicious since it was the first two dishes that came out and we were both starving. The new flavors was a welcoming taste to my taste-buds. However, by the last few bites of the first two dishes we started noticing a pattern, it was overly salty. The blade steak came with a side of nduja and greens. The flavor was there, but again - over-salted. The greens was the worst, why does veggie have to be so salty!?! Next came the pork shoulder, we both each had literally two bites before we gave up because of salt-OD. Last came the turkey leg, and same thing. We took two bites and packed the rest to go. Overall, I was disappointed and even more surprising is only one other Yelper commented on how salty everything is. The potential is definitely there, because I can taste a lot of flavor and assorted ingredients in every dish. Sadly, this is all drowned out by the over-seasoning of salt. Someone please let the Purple Pig know that salt is not going out of style, and there is no need to use it this generously.",N

Why I think this place deserves 5 stars: 1. The staff is very good 2. The menus is clean, easy to read, well rounded, different but not over the top exotic. 3. The food was VERY good, a bit expensive, but what can you do? 4. Everything was served with impeccable timing 5. The selection is not overwhelming 6. TRY THE BROWNIE, enough said about my 5 star rating... As you can see, I am a big fan. My ideal dining experience is where I can order lots of small yet tasty dishes and try everything.

What's nice is that you have the opportunity to take in our fine city while waiting outside...that is, if it's not winter. Lucky for my fiancee, friend and I it was decent out...just a bit nippy. We wound up waiting like an hour, and were seated outside next to a couple heating lamps. Oh wells. Our server was nice and attentive, recommending dishes as we perused the menu. TPP's headline is ""Cheese, Swine, & Wine."" We opted out of the first and third, jumping into a number of swanky swine dishes. With that said, realize that much of the menu will be fried, salty, or savory. Don't be surprised when your swine comes out. Some highlights: I've gotta say that I thought I knew bone marrow...boy was I wrong. I've tried it a couple times and thought it was meh, but I think that's because I wasn't eating quality prepared bone marrow. So savory. Melts in your mouth. For being all about swine, TPP does chicken and red meat pretty well. Chicken kabobs with fried smashed potatoes were delish, as was the wagyu sirloin tip. I understand the Bib Gourmand love from the Michelin guide...kinda. Walking out, I felt a little hungry, and my pocket felt a little lighter than I'd hoped.

Naturally, our order wasn't quite right: strike two. The food itself was chewy pasta, drowned in canned sauce and an inch of cheese. No flavor except fat in the Fettucini Alfredo - I've had better Stouffers dinners - and the marinara was a runny mess of tomato water. Plus, $1.50 for the 1/4 cup side of sauce to cover the rest of the pasta? Strike three, I'm outta there. It cost $20 without tip for two tiny bowls of nasty pasta.

On that note, this was my first experience with Chicago deep dish pizza (as this was my first time to Chicago - where I am moving soon). My experience there was great, but not perfect because the deep dish pizza wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. The service here is immaculate. The waiter was very friendly and came to our table several times even though he was outrageously busy. It takes roughly 45 minutes to get your pizza, so I wish I took advice that I saw online and pre-ordered it so that when we arrived we didn't have to wait as long. But, that wait wasn't bad at all, compared to a lot of other places I have been to. The wait was worth it because as you sit there you get to see some of the history of the place. The writing on the walls, the pictures, etc. etc. etc. The food was really, really good. But, it wasn't what I was expecting from deep dish pizza. There was a lot of crust for a pizza. More crust than toppings. As for the toppings, there was a lot of cheese and not enough sauce and pepperoni for my taste. I am lactose-intolerant (even though I still eat dairy), but I'd much rather not eat a pound of cheese in a few slices of pizza (haha). But, for what it was - it was really good. It was well worth it for me. It was overall a great experience for me and I'm glad that I finally got to compare and contrast on which is better: NYC or Chicago pizza?

And if we hadn't been let in at the right moment, I would have spoken to the bouncer as one of the house rules at the Violet Hour is not bringing anyone you wouldn't want at your mother's house for Sunday supper. These three were definitely not welcome guests. I lost track of them and perhaps they were let in after all. I saw someone with a baseball cap on and it was clearly against their house rules. Still, the Violet Hour speaks of a certain genteelness and charm. The highbacked chairs reminded me of the chairs on the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. They afforded privacy and perhaps a few secrets were exchanged. Although they didn't entirely block your view. The booth next to our table was clearly on display and vice versa. The cocktail menu is short but the book of liquors was quite heavy. I opted for one of their signature cocktails since we weren't at the bar. I tend to like to sit at the bar and chat with the bartender to get a custom cocktail. The one I ordered from their list was fantastic. Alas, we only had time for one before we disappeared into the night. But considering the pub crawl we had the night before, it was probably for the best.",N

18675,XTtZn-PZlHYeX1arx1KNFg,"Another winner from Jerry Kleiner. This is my first thought when it comes to taking a large group out, especially boisterous out of towners you want to please. Large, loud, and grandeur really sums Carnivale up. The interior of this place is unmatched by any other restaurant. It starts out with a very large bar area outside the entrance where you can mingle over a mojito while you're waiting for your table. The dagger is entering into the  theatre-like main dining room with its gigantic ceilings and wild bold color. The walls lining it are stocked with unreachable wine bottles, and large colorful lanterns hang down from the ceilings.        Oh, and the food. Fabulous Nuevo Latino cuisine; try a ceviche tasting sampler to start off; includes ahi tuna, fluke, and scallops. Try the arrachera (skirt steak) for your entree, or the borrego (wood-grilled lamb).        And don't forget to keep the drinks flowing. The reserve wine list is impressive. I'm also a weakling for a good rasberry mojito after dinner. Arrrrrrriba!",N

Wish Summer wasn't over as once the nice outdoor patio closes, I'll have to start waiting for tables during peak hours, as the place isn't all that large. They have extremely creative burgers/toppings, and a variety of seasonings for their fries (Old Bay seasoning on fries is awesome!). The actual burger itself is tasty, but not as good as Jury's -- probably my only neg, and it's a nit-picky one. That being said, Jury's doesn't have the variety/toppings that Bad Apple has. I like both restaurants, but for different reasons. The Edmund Fig-Gerald, Frenchie, and Black & Blue are my favorite custom burgers. The Slow Burn burger definitely burned -- those who have spicy palates will enjoy. When the plates come out, they seem small at first. Then at the end, I feel stuffed. Because of that, I've never had an appetizer but my friends say the poutine is really good. The beer list is massive and well chosen, and the bartenders and wait staff are very knowledgeable.

40093,XjN5Gqds9VPwDn2S7uPylA,"I originally rated Meli with 5 stars, after being a regular customer over the life of the retaurant. In recent months, I've had some bad experiences that were completely due to the staff or operational structure of Meli that have severly damaged the light in which I see the restaurant.  This delightful little cafe was a such wonderful addition to the Greektown collection when it opened its doors.  It is such a treat to be able to dine in Greektown with out flaming cheese searing your eyebrows from your forehead, or being surrounded by tons of Greek men with chest hair peeking through the open, top buttons...even if I too am one of those guys. Once you enter the cafe, you are not only greeted by a lovely array of soothing colors and decorations reminiscent of a European sidewalk cafe, but an absolutely enticing aromas.  A redolence of homemade pastries, smoothies, jams, marmalades and fresh squeezed juices fill the room.  After you soak in the wonderful smells, the site of a server carrying a tray full of mouthwatering breakfast treats will double your hunger pangs immediately. The downfall is that whether you order a side of small pancakes, or a larger order of full size pancakes, you get a little one, maybe 2 oz of maple syrup. If you need more, you pay $0.75 for each little cup. Now, I'm no economist, but I'm pretty sure they aren't making their own maple syrup, but even in the even that they are, Maple Syrup isn't that expensive. I shouldn't have to be able to buy a whole bottle of syrup with how much I spend just to get my pancakes damp with the stuff. I understand charging for extra jellies, as they are all made in house... but come one... Syrup?!? I'd rather just bring some Aunt Jemima with me next time. I was also forced to buy honey to add to my tea in this same visit. I expected to get the expensive, thick, Greek honey upon paying for it, to my dismay, it was normal, every day honey. There goes another star. The Smoothies are less than appetizing at Meli. I find that while they use fresh fruits, that they often taste watered down compared to what I receive at my gym, or even a Jamba Juice. Now to the entrees... The Spicy Flamenco - a large omelette with various peppers, chorizo, avocado slices and sour cream.  This is served with Baby red potatos and a slice of melon...AMAZING!  I have never left hungry after dining on this one of a kind breakfast gem. The Crab Cakes Benedict - Crab cakes and eggs benedict are both new additions to my edible repertoire.  I find that over time, I've been less impressed with this dish the more I order it. I've finally given up on it. The Cloud Nine Crepe - This is a fat kid's fantasy breakfast!!! This is a chocolate infused crepe served with sweetened marscapone, covered with fresh berries chocolate sauce and whipped cream. Dessert AND Breakfast, all wrapped up in one....excuse me, whilst I wipe the drool from my chin. The ""Mana Mou"" - Meaning most literally ""My mother"" and the self proclaimed mother of all skillets, it is jam packed with Angus steak, portobello, red onions, bell peppers, and topped off with Provolone.  I had to loosen my belt just typing that. I would however, advise you to leave yourself time to visit.  It isn't a Denny's or an IHOP. I used to eat at Meli nearly every week, but over the last several months I've barely visited. I find paying for extra maple syrup by the ounce to be ridiculous and frustrating. That very next day, however, I returned with my friends for breakfast, after ordering nearly $75 worth of food for breakfast for 3 people, I had requested 2 dollars in quarters to feed the meter (pre paybox). The waitress returned only to hand me 4 quarters from the two $1 singles I had given her. She said I can only give you one dollar in quarters, so I asked if the other dollar was some sort of a service fee for change. She said no, but that the hostess would speak to me shortly about it. I received a visit from the hostess who took it upon herself to lecture me about their inability to provide everyone with change for the meters. But she was completely happy to accept my $75 for breakfast that day, and just over $50 the day before. Perhaps instead of speaking to your regular customers like children, you should take a lesson in customer service and economics. Those 4 quarters have cost you several hundred dollars in business. That cost will only go up over time, as I take my business to Yolk or Lou Mitchell's. All in all, Meli loses a star for the nickle & diming, and two stars for customer service. It's one thing to turn a customer down for change (minus one star) but another to speak down to and scold a customer for having the nerve to ask for an extra four quarters, which is where Meli loses the third star. I realize that this is harsh, but after being such a regular and loyal customer from day one and for bringing so many people in to Meli, I think I deserved a little more courtesy.",N
51721,H6W,"I saw Rose Polenzani perform at the new Uncommon Ground in Rogerswater (edgepark? but i digress...) tonight.   I looked at the menu online and had braced myself for overly pretentious food in small portions.  Luckily, I was wrong on both counts.  I ordered the chopped salad and a side of sweet potato fries, with coffee.  The salad was huge and everything in it was absolutely delicious--the chicken was juicy and tender, the avocado was perfectly ripe, the bacon was a nice touch.   The amount of dressing was exactly right.  I was so pleased that while it was $9 or so (that's a lot for me, i guess i'm cheap) I could only eat half of it and took home the other half for dinner #2.   The sweet potato fries were divine, though I wish they had a half-portion because there were just too damn many of them.   The sound was awesome and the setting was intimate yet still spacious enough that you don't have to dine on top of the people you are seated next to. I will be honest--though it was perfectly lovely, the prices are a bit much for me to be able to visit this place that regularly.  Especially if I want to have a drink with my meal.   But when you think about it, I suppose it's better to get one really good drink for the price of two mediocre ones. All in all, welcome to the neighborhood Uncommon Ground.  You are a great addition to Devon.",N

However, there is a certain waiter that we always wish wld not be our server, unfortunately we are not always in luck and the latest incident was I thought very annoying and worthy of sharing (thus the 3 stars only rating).

In the meantime, we see our waiter taking orders from various customers who has just come in and taking checks.

38973,PQiv7X8ManTE3D5cpX85Uw,"Immediately off the Red Line Argyle stop is where you will find this gem of a restaurant. I come here for the duck.  If the rest of the food is anywhere near as well-prepared, it is amazing too.  But this is a review about duck.  Quack. The Peking Duck meal at Sun Wah consists of three courses: The skin/meat/bun course, the duck soup, and the duck fried rice.   Some people subscribe to a ""save the best for last"" policy, but that will not hold here.  The first course is the standout in an already excellent meal.  The waitress (who is extremely knowledgable and friendly) carves the crispy skin off of the beautifuly roast duck, and presents it on a plate, along with steamed buns, some carrot/scallion, and this amazing Hoisin sauce that they make themselves - it is a bit thinner and much more delicious than anything you will buy in a jar.  I'd drink a cup of the stuff if it weren't so awkward to ask for.  It is left to us, the diners, to assemble all of this into little sandwiches and enjoy.  It is an incredible flavor and mix of textures. While you are still in the midst of enjoying all of this, the servers will come out with a very large bowl of soup.  The soup consists of duck broth, duck bones (sounds a little weird, but it's where all the flavor comes from - so don't be freaked out!), some cucumber, and egg.  The soup is light, and is a great follow-up to all the meat and bread you've just eaten!  Next they bring out a giant platter of duck fried rice (made with your leftover meat), which is DELICIOUS, but difficult to eat much of at the time because by then I am usually full. The good news is that they will pack all of your leftovers up for you and send you home with boxes full of your leftover duck.  The fried rice reheats well, and I've put the leftover meat into dishes like duck risotto and duck nachos.   All of this comes for $30 per meal (NOT per person!).  Beer is cheap too.  I highly recommend this not just for the meal, but the entire experience!",N
44030,ku9aTTvHKI1GpIc31u2Bmw,"Give me a break.  I'm reading all of these things about this place having a ""Michelin star.""  Maybe you have to be a foodie to know what that is, or just a really easily influenced individual to take that kind of rating into consideration when it comes to selecting a place for dinner, but considering my experience last Friday night, a Michelin star must mean ""Stay away from here if you want a yummy dinner."" We expected a wait, and were told it would be an hour.  We sat at the bar for an hour and a half, and this is where the good beer list comes in handy.  After a long wait, two drinks, and 90 minutes of an obnoxiously loud business school student drunkenly knocking me off my bar stool and apologizing at regular intervals, we were called over to our table, where we both ordered the burgers.  The key here is that we both very clearly ordered them cooked ""medium."" What we got was two gigantic bloody gobs of ground beef on buns that were absolutely soaked through with red on the bottom.  But we didn't notice this until we cut into them.  The first thing we noticed was the complete lack of cheese on both burgers.  There were like 2 cheese shreds on each burger, which the chef had tried to cover with fatty, undercooked bacon that looked like it had been tied in a knot.  I'm not sure how to describe how insanely lacking the cheese was.  It was like if cheese clipped its toenails, this is what would be left over.  It was like if you asked for no cheese and a little bit accidentally got dripped onto your burger and was wiped off with a paper towel.  It was like if a piece of cheese coughed onto your burger.  I'm talking silly amounts of cheese.  It was like anti-cheese. So we apologized to the waiter for bothering him, and he was really nice about it.  He looked at our burgers and said, ""Yeah, that does look really skimpy on the cheese..."" and returned with a single slice for us to share.  This was confusing since I'm sure that I've ordered this in the past and each burger has gotten its own slice of cheese.  But whatever.  Then we cut into our burgers and it was like mini car accidents had taken place on our plates.  I've had a rare burger before, okay?  And I've had a medium burger before.  But I don't think that I should see a cooked edge stuffed with raw meat that can be scooped out with a fork.  And I don't think the bottom bun should be bright red and disgustingly soggy and wet.  So, we called our waiter back again.  He was very understanding, again.  And though we had only been at our table for half an hour and hadn't taken so much as a single bite of food, when he took our burgers off the table, the over-attentive bus staff completely cleared our table of napkins and utensils, as if we were finished. A second waiter took us over, as I suppose we were the problem table of the evening.  Our burgers were returned, with a free bowl of fries for us to share in the middle of the table.  The burgers were cooked properly, cheesed properly, presented properly...they just tasted like nothing.  Dry, bread-y, and unseasoned.  We shared a napkin I'd been lucky enough to have hidden in my lap when the bus staff swooped in, while watching the tables on each side of us receive cute little samples from the kitchen and refills of water.  That restaurant was finished with us, obviously.  You could tell the waiters felt bad but--seriously?  Raw burgers after 2 hours in the place, and you bring us a bowl of fries to complement the fries that come with the meal? It's really a shame that this place has gotten so highly rated.  When it was new, I enjoyed it, even with the wait.  It wasn't packed with loud, drunk douchebags who are only there because of an Esquire article, so waiting was tolerable.  The kitchen was still trying to become highly rated, so the kitchen was still trying.  Now that they're lauded as The Place To Go in Logan Square, they're sticking to whatever gets people in and out the quickest.  That's because as soon as the droves of people who believe everything they read start to darken the doorway, the place could serve sliced canned dog food with a sprig of something styled ""wild crimson fennel"" on top and nobody will know the difference.  ""Oh my God, you have GOT to try the sliced dog food with the wild crimson fennel!  It's simply to DIE for!!!""",N
39234,CSZgae06PNtB4SgG6gy3FA,"Go right for oysters and clam bar. Go left for the entire ocean.  I had oysters, chopped Cesar salad (even the anchovy was fresh) and king crab legs (""we get them from the guys on the discovery channel""). Some of the most succulent I have ever munched on.  There is an amazing variety of seafood including stone crab (best enjoyed cold with mustard sauce) and Copperhead river salmon (i.e. didn't swim in its own shit for 8 months on a fish farm).  Atmosphere on the right side is a total bar scene, noisy and packed. Atmosphere on the left is busy, refined, restored warehouse, feel.  Great choice if you love fresh seafood.",N

LOL, but I love that they give you that option, because it really did have a lot of children running around in the front.  The bar area is nice and was quieter.  It is a large restaurant and the whole place is decorated very colorful and neat looking, so the atmosphere is good.  The food, not so much.  Maybe it's just too big to concentrate on quality? I got the veggie burger, which was mushy and bland.  There was no sauce on it, no cheese, just a very bland patty, on a plain white bread kieser roll.  It came with no side dish, as if someone is going to order a burger and nothing else?  You have to pay extra for 1 side dish, so I had the rice and beans side dish, also bland and unappealing.  The mac-and-cheese my dining partner had was a small portion and lacked cheesiness.  We got two tiny corn muffins and we had to ask for water twice.  Before this time, I came once in the evening, late.  I understand they were going to close, but they clearly said they were still open and let us in without an issue.  The food was nasty, cold in the middle as it had been reheated via microwave.  They do have carrot juice, which is good, but carrot juice is hard to screw up.  I was also there for brunch before, where I had the french toast.  It was bland once again, and had little batter on it.  It needed cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg or something, because it was not good. All in all, I would NOT want to go here again.",N

Our favorite pizza is the plain style with whatever we decide should go on it for that day. Their plain style is less cheese than a normal pizza but has all the satisfying flavor because of the garlicky red sauce. If your on a first date I might suggest against another style ;) My favorite beer... wow... that is a hard choice. I would have to say it is.... not a decision I can make. Try every single one.

As he stood deciding if what he wanted was worth it, I struck up a conversation with one of the sales associates about places to try being a newcomer to the area. She recommended Violet Hour and said it was very easy to get to. I knew it was close by and just assumed she suggested it for that reason, so I took her advice with a grain of salt and headed home for dinner. It was then that my boyfriend suggested we look it up and POOF back to wicker park we went. The place is mind blowing. The door and door handle are hidden by graffiti but once you find it and go inside everything is gorgeous, dimly lit, and with a ballroom-esque 1920's pre prohibition era feel. Comfy high backed chairs and flowing curtains make for private little nooks in an otherwise airy room. Cocktails are not cheap- $12 each, but worth every penny! The bartenders there are more of mixologists, they make every ingredient on premise so freshness (and did I mention strongness) is never a question. I'm not even a gin person but the waitress suggested the Juliet and Romeo for me which was AMAZING- gin, mint, rosewater, I think that was it, and I was d-runk without so much as a single gag.

The pho completely bland and needed to be doused with lime and cilantro and the bun bo hue was basically a bowl of chili oil with noodles in it. Look, it's supposed to be spicy and flavorful, complex and palatable, it is not supposed to be more flammable to a match than high octane gas. There is a delicate balance in Vietnamese food that must be attained, that's what makes it such a wonderful cuisine, and yet it is also what can make it so awful. I've had superior pho at Pho Binh Minh in Kentucky(of all places) and in numerous pho shops in the Bay Area(the world's culinary paradise). I have yet to find a pho shop here in Chicago that is flavorful and complex. There was one upside and that was my Vietnamese coffee. Actually, no, it was mediocre and clearly pre-prepared in mass quantities. You're supposed to make the Vietnamese coffee fresh each time, otherwise it tastes absolutely foul.

The squash and broccoli soup topped with bacon and cheddar? Deeeelish. By the time my entree came around (the chicken sandwich with avocado, onions, greens, tomato and aioli) I was stuffed.

Not to mention the waitress was so on top of refills that I was never without my caffeine. Big bonus as far as I'm concerned. In the end we were both far too full to try the desserts which made me sad because the pumpkin cheesecake sounded to die for. Hohum guess I'll just have to go back for more! I took the rest of my chicken sandwich home and ate it for dinner the next night and it held up remarkably well. The chicken was still moist and flavorful and the veggies were still fresh. Excellent.

The food, however, is what made me go back again! It's so fresh. The staff is friendly. You must make room for dessert, particularly the Iris. 2 drawbacks for me: no reservations and small space. The first time I went here was for a late lunch, and they sat us down right away. Dinner...forget about! 1.5 hour wait!!! Went to a movie and came back for late night dinner. Great tasting food, so would go back again again.",N

11914,wpLuTrPx9WQGp56bR29gaw,"Finally, three years after moving to Chicago I eat at the Bongo Room. Why did I wait so long? Because I won't wait to eat brunch, and all the reviews describing long waits turned me off to eating here. The solution? Come on a weekday. Sure, it's still relatively crowded but you won't have to endure longer than a 10 minute wait. That, I can do. So, my experience... divine! I arrived with a stomach dangerously hovering on empty and my usual craving for oh, about 6 cups of coffee. I eyed the menu well into my second refill... choices, delicious choices! I decided on the breakfast burrito (my go-to when dining out for brekkie) which turned out to be big AND beautiful. I almost finished all of it. Probably one of my favorite breakfast burritos outside of San Diego. I also snagged a bite (okay, three) of my dining companion's red velvet pancakes. Decadent as the cake and topped with a cream cheesy icing, Oh my! Service was quite efficient and never in your face... just the way I like it. I'll definitely be back!",N

50570,nMxm-vLZE11m8UP0LyB3ZA,"The past few times I've been here I haven't been overly impressed, yet I keep coming back so I must like it enough. They have an enormous menu of upscale chain style food that offers pretty much anything you could want.   The atmosphere is nice kind of swanky with dim lighting and dark colors.  I prefer it during the day because it's so dark at night unless you are near the window which everyone wants. The view of the Christmas lights on Michigan Ave was pretty great even though we weren't sitting there. Our server made some pretty weird comments, but otherwise the food came out very fast and the service was good. The pasta fresca is ok- heavy on the vegetables and light on the pasta. Had to have cheese grater man dump a LOT on.  Key Lime Pie is awesome and more than enough for 2 people to split.  You can find dinners here anywhere from $8 to $30 depending on what you get. I think you can find this quality of food, service, and atmosphere elsewhere but it's a fun downtown place to go every once in awhile.

Cool paintings and photographs decorate the exposed brick walls. It was bustling but why not with their huge brunch menu? Huge compared to the limited selection that other places offer.

The last time I had rice & beans this good was in Puerto Rico. I ordered the Ropa Vieja ($11.95) which came with rice, black beans & sweet fried plantains.  My shredded pork was bursting with flavor and I could not believe how tender they cooked it.  Portions here are more than generous so expect to take a doggy bag home too. Service here really blew my mind.  Every server was coming around asking if we needed anything, how our food was, etc.  So it was actually hard to tell which one was our waiter!  At the end of our meal, Harry, owner/manager?, came by to chat & we found out that they'll be expanding to the house next door.   This is a great BYOB joint.  There's a CVS on Armitage & Milwaukee (a block away) for liquor needs.  Will definitely bring in a bottle of rum next time to try their mojitos!",N
47077,wSRnd3zDN,"This is my favorite Chicago Pizza place to get Pizza by the slice for their Pan and Stuffed. Their crust for each has a nice buttery softness that's a little easier to bite into than other pan or stuff places, like Giordano's (which I also love). Crust has just the right amount of flavor, not overdone. Cheese and ingredients are fresh and reasonably priced.   Their thin crust is generous on the cheese and, like their Pan/stuff crust, has plenty of flavor. Their thin Meaty Delight is my favorite chicago-styled thin crust pizza in the city. I am not a meat lovers fan either, but this is the exception to that. The inside is casual, BYOB, and plenty of seating. Though it's not a place that's really known as a dine-in restaurant, mainly because their service and quality is great on their delivery and carry-out. That said, a good amount of people bring in beer on weekends for dine-in. Definitely not your typically deserted take-out place. They also have great weekly deals on non-pizza menu items.",N

It was all very tasty, but way too much fried food for me! I highly recommend splitting the fish and chips, as the portions are quite generous. The salads looked awfully good, also. My dinner companions were also quite happy with the mashed potatoes. I would have loved to try the bacon popcorn, but at the wise urging of my group, decided against it in fear of the tummy havoc that may come later! The beer was also exceptional.

40482,4iOoBShtPANuwJHuqFPR9w,"There's been some swapping going on at Hopleaf over the last several months. At some point, apparently they stopped using brewery-specific glassware and substituted a few standard shapes/sizes of Hopleaf-stamped glasses.  I'm sure that this improved efficiency and increased their brand exposure, but it cost them some personality. On the upside, they upgraded the cramped quarters to...well, slightly less cramped quarters.  Let's face it, even with the new dining room and the summertime patio, this place still gets swamped with customers on a Saturday night. Perhaps most rewardingly of all, they seem to have ditched the pretension.  Or at least I can say that our most recent server, while dressed for Logan Square, gave Loop-perfect service.  Don't judge a book by its cover!  I wish that I had caught his name because he deserves a special mention. They seem to have enhanced the depth and variety on their dinner menu, to the point that my red-meat-averse wife finds a few appealing options.  But we both agreed that the execution of our meals could have been better.  I had the brisket platter and found it downright boring. The onion ""rings"" starter turned out to be strings, very greasy and salty.  That was disappointing, but the brownie dessert was phenomenal (especially when paired at home with my wife's outstanding homemade vanilla frozen custard). Hopleaf 2012:  Two steps forward, one step back.  Or is it the other way around?  It's still a great spot, but no longer mighty, despite the improvements.  These days, the beer list is equalled by many others in the city.  So you're fighting those crowds for a food and drink experience which is no longer top-drawer.",N
30590,nL-SuW6jQOR16bXMeppKrQ,"Normally, I'm not a fan of any ""ethnic"" restaurants located in Gold Coast/River North because my immediate reaction to them is usually something along the lines of ""I can get the same quality food for half the price in Chinatown/Argyle/Pilsen/etc"".  What can I say - the frugal in me is hard to keep down.  But my fiancée has been clamoring to go to Frontera Grill ever since she started watching Rick Bayless on Top Chef Masters (damn you, Bravo!).  So off we went this past Saturday to grab brunch at Frontera Grill and to see how legit is the Bayless hype.   The first thing we realized about Frontera Grill was that the Top Chef Masters effect was definitely in ... uh ... full effect.  We were quoted a one hour wait for brunch, which I thought was a little bit crazy considering the size of the restaurant.  But then we learned that dining at the bar is first-come-first-serve so we immediately swooped in on a couple empty bar stools.  Unless you're with a large group, I would definitely recommend eating at the bar - full menu with little to no wait.  Plus the bartenders do a pretty decent job multitasking between taking care of customers who are eating and making drinks so no drop off in service either. Anyway, what about the food?  Well, I won't say it blew me away but it was pretty damn good.  Here's what we got: Drink 1: Blackberry Mojito ($10.00) - Refreshing and sweet.  Great summer drink.  Not very boozy but still quite delicious. Drink 2: Mezcal Margartia ($10.00) - Despite having a pinkish color, the drink itself had a rather smoky flavor.  Definitely not like a regular margarita but in a good way. Appetizer: ""Entrems Surtido"" ($7.50 per person) - Basically a sampler appetizer platter that included quesadillas, taquitos ceviche, jicama salad and guacamole.  Warning: this dish is HUGE.  As good as everything was on the plate, I almost wouldn't recommend it because you'll be so full after eating it that you won't have any room left for your entrees. Entrée 1: ""Tacos al Carbon"" ($15.00) - You can pick from a list of meats; my fiancée went with duck, which she thought was quite tasty.  The dish comes with guacamole, beans, salsa and tortillas and the portions are pretty hefty, especially after chowing down on the ""Entrems Surtido"". Entrée 2:  ""Pozole Rojo"" ($11.50) - A pork and hominy stew with a poached egg on top.  The pork was very tender and the soup was bursting with flavor.  I think I would've enjoyed this dish even more if it was 30 degrees out but it was still quite good despite it being a hot summer day.  The stew comes with lettuce, radishes and tortilla chips on the side, which I think you're supposed to toss into the stew to give it some crunch (that's what I did at least). All in all, it was a very good meal.  The food wasn't remarkable in that I feel like I've had comparable dishes at other places in Chicago (Mixteco, Fonda del Mar) but it was still very tasty and everything was prepared well.  The prices are a little high for what you're getting but still pretty reasonable.  My advice is to not buy into the hype that's been generated by Bayless's success on Top Chef Masters and just go in with no expectations except to have a good meal.  I think as long as you're not excepting to be blown away, you'll enjoy Frontera Grill.",N
33678,ixgMUza,"Been here a couple of times when they first opened. Food was pretty good. Definitely different from the normal burgers and hot dogs in the area. Waitstaff was super friendly. I like that their menu changes with the seasons, meaning I'm getting fresh items, not frozen stuff. The only downside is pricing. I think some of the items are overpriced. Since they've gotten so popular after being on Check Please, Diners Dives & Drive Thrus and shows like these, I've passed by and see the line out the door. Sorry, but I don't want to wait that long for brunch. That might be why they can keep the prices high because they're still getting a steady stream of folks in.  I'll still hit up Nana's just not as often.",N

""I say 2, I hope we don't need a reservations."" I can see several empty tables. Host says, 'i can seat you, but you have to be out in an hour and half?"" Seriously? Or you have to wait 2 hours.

Bread and butter pickles, yummy, and the chips with the BBQ seasoning were great. The second bowl of chips were nasty. Probably what they serve when you ask for seconds. They were overcooked, bitter tasting and were much darker. We ordered the Onion Rings, Hush puppies and split a dinner item of the 1/2 slab baby back ribs and pulled pork with cole slaw. The onions rings were OK. To me they could have been cooked longer and most were missing batter. They serve them with a sour cream dill sauce. i didn't like the combo, but I dipped  the rings in the chipotle sauce that came with the hush puppies that were good. Main course was meh, OK. Came with a plate of different sauce. The regular BBQ sauce was way to sweet, the mustard one tasted like honey mustard and the only one i liked was the spicy sauce, but it too was overly sweet.  The meat was typical BBQ fair, nothing out of this world, but it was edible.

53271,CPhxFhZbxIp,"I had a great meal at Publican over the weekend. I can understand some of the misgivings people have, but to me, the menu is unique enough to make this place worth visiting. We started off with the chef's tasting of the oysters. 6 different types of oysters, all fresh and delicious. I was very impressed by the freshness and diversity of the oysters. It's hard to find great oysters outside of high-end restaurants and I haven't seen this much variety anywhere not on the coast, so for me this is a huge draw. Another highlight was the sweetbreads which were lightly breaded and served with a very light, vinegary sauce. They were so good that we were able to convince a very picky eater at the table to try them (before we told her what sweetbreads are). She loved them, but refused to eat more when we spilled the beans. Also the squid ink pasta had excellent texture and deep flavor that complemented the shrimp it was served with perfectly. And of course the excellent pork rinds have been well documented. The fries (which I think are fried in duck fat) were very rich but the egg on top didn't add much for me. If I were to order fries again, it would be without the egg and preferably with a side of aioli. The only miss for me was the sturgeon which was rather flavorless, though I suspect this may be more a product of my preference for stronger tasting fish. Also I have to mention the top notch beer selection. I started off with a bottle of De Ranke XX which I had never seen before. It was a very hoppy Belgian IPA that seemed a little over-hopped, but I was glad I was able to try a different beer in one of my favorite styles. The second beer I had, which was on tap, was something that ended in Urbock (I forget the full name). I was expecting a nice malty German bock, but instead got the best rauchbier (smoke beer) I've ever had. It was creamy and only slightly smokey but enough to add tremendous character to the beer. The fact that Publican has a beer of this quality and rarity on tap is a huge selling point in my eyes. Publican specializes in fish, pork, and beer and I think they deal with all three in a way few other restaurants do.",N

Now on to important matters: I had the bone-in Kansas City cut (recommended).  Of course, I got my ""skrimp"" cocktail on before hand.  It came with this ATOMIC (it's literally called that) horsey sauce that will burn a whole right through your sinuses.  Think wasabi on steroids.

47968,yWBZyzcxHy3dTVcTlxVyaA,"Back in my Yelp rube days, I called this my favorite steakhouse in Chicago.  I've been rethinking that today, but I'll probably let it stand.  I reevaluate because it doesn't seem special enough; however, it's always at least ""good"" across the board, if not necessarily great, and I haven't found another place that knocks my socks off.  I've probably dined five or six times and always enjoyed myself.   Last night I talked a friend into accompanying me for the Winter Delights prix fixe menu.  Even if the food is mediocre, you can't beat a $20 deal.  Thankfully, most of the food was far better than mediocre. I started with the chophouse salad (just a plain salad, but with a decent honey-mustard dressing) but also ordered a calamari appetizer to share (not on the prix fixe menu).  The calamari were very good; there seemed to be something in the batter giving it more than just a standard fried flavor.  The accompanying marinara was bland, but there was also a sort of Cajunish remoulade kind of dip which was really, really good. Beef medallions entree:  this seemed like a generous portion for a $20 prix fixe.  Kudos to the restaurant for that.  And it was damn good, too, served with ""bacon and scallion smashed potatoes"" and a ""mushroom cabernet demi-glace.""  Those are solid, basic flavors put together very well by the Kinzie kitchen.  You can never go wrong with mushrooms, red wine, and steak--those three compliment each other like whiskey, loneliness, and bad decisions.  The steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare too. And dessert!  I opted for the flourless chocolate cake and was NOT disappointed--quite the opposite, in fact.  Flourless cakes are often too rich and/or boring, but this version was one of the best that I've had.  It was the perfect balance of solid and gooey, not too potent and not too bland (satisfying the Goldilocks in me).  I tried a bite of my friend's rum cheesecake and--I say this as a staunch hater of cheesecake--I would have eaten an entire slice, it was that good.",N

I also highly recommend the crispy rice pan fried sushi - I've tried both the spicy tuna and kobe beef. The spicy tuna was very good but the kobe beef - ridiculously amazing. It's a rare occasion when I prefer beef over any type of seafood but Sunda has found a way to make it happen. I've also tried a few of the sushi rolls - rainbow roll, mushroom lover, tail of two tunas, spicy tuna, and firecracker. All good, expect the mushroom lover was pretty disappointing. Being a mushroom lover myself, I figured this roll was meant for me. It was pretty flavorless and disappointing. I definitely wouldn't order it again.

Than I got mad, and was ready to walk out, the manager said the restaurant will pay for our two drinks( $7.00 each). I don't think it is enough for spoiled B-day and Saturday evening.

Overall, this is a good attempt at the cured meats/small plate/cheese concept, and has the makings of being really good. We arrived at around 6pm, and it was already getting crowded.  The space is quite small, and I can see that there are probably seating issues later in the evenings, but we did manage to score a nice, two person table in a corner. The decor is warm, and I particularily liked the tilework on the booth wall.   Our service was fantastic.  Our server was well informed on the different cured meat, cheese, and wine choices, and helped us select a delicious spread to chow on prior to sampling some of the small plates. The pig's ear was decent, and the Wagyu steak was tasty.  Not spectacular, but definitely decent. Dessert was also a big plus.  We had a fried doughnutty thing with cheese and chocolate filling, as well as the butterscotch pudding.   Both were delicious!

4484,Fjab-fg2Batr7s3UQLZQcg,"10/10. well, i am biased. so what? how can i not be biased about a restaurant run by bunch of humble people, who are absolute experts and artists? i have been going to schwa now for almost 5 years (4.5) ...last time i was at schwa was around 7 or 8 months ago. so hard to get in, even though i always try to have a standing reservation there, and insist ""guys whenever there is an opening just call me, i come..."" they called me today and asked me if i wanted to go. wow, on a saturday evening, going there alone? will i not waste their table? i asked them but they were friendly and welcoming as always... they also told me to dress comfortably because the restaurant is pretty warm... all obedient me walked there from my home.... ambiance: 10/10 (taking away the air condition factor). food: 10/10 service: 10/10 value: 10/10.  can i rate that higher? schwa can easily charge 30 bucks more and be ahead of others in terms of value. in the last two weeks i have been to some so called pricy restaurants including alinea, L2O, and moto...all around schwa stands out. don't take me wrong. alinea is an experience that i welcome anytime...schwa, aside from act of god reservation, is no event. it is simple, beautiful, delicious, everything without hitting you on the head. also the price is reasonable, so much so, that i normally leave about 28 to 30% tip. one thing i noticed at schwa is that even here, guys with a mate on a date, still walk ahead of their womenses...guys, please first show the womenses the way, not that they donot know, go to the left, extend the left arm, open the door and walk behind of them. you still get to the car at the same time. anyways in places like schwa this shows less as the restaurant is small. in places like L2O where there is a long walk and the womenses (archi bunker, i love you) walk on their so high heels, with their shoulders totally bent forward to keep their balance it shows a lot more. i hope schwa will be recognized on michelin...if not, good yelpers will know where to go anyways.",N
26720,sKmN13EuRMjGGcQV6TD7aQ,"First the good: Service was solid and attentive without being obtrusive. The live flamenco was a nice touch and it definitely was a romantic venue. BUT, the food was terrible. The cheese fondue course was not gruyere and ementhaler but rather tasted like cheese whiz and roux with the kirsch and white wine. The chocolate fondue tasted like warmed Hershey's syrup. The meat seafood course did not save the day reaching the oxymoronic pinnacle of mediocrity. Our theory, given the large number of tables that seemed to have a GroupOn, is that the kitchen decided to skimp on ingredients to make up for the lost leader, which in any case marks it as a restaurant on the decline. In this time of excellent, accessible fine cuisine, Geja's only proves that those unable to adapt deserve their extinction. I really hate to say this, given my aversion to chain restaurants, but the Melting Pot does a far, far better job when it comes to fondue.",N
6571,T0Fh5A7YZ6zaTL0USaHeDg,"Came here on a business trip since it was short walk from our hotel and garnered many rave reviews from Yelp. This place screams steakhouse with the decor drenched in dark wood and the upbeat atmosphere. Towards the back was the open kitchen which slightly threw off the dark decor but leaked out the enticing aroma of charred meat. We were a party of 14 yet the service was just attentive and on point. I know at times, when accommodating a large party, some dishes tend to come out faster than others thus creating an awkward moment between the haves and have nots until all dishes arrived. However all of our entrees came out at the same time piping hot, ready to be eaten. We started off some some of the pizzas which were great to nibble on yet didn't fill you up as you prepared to gorge on the main attraction - the steaks! I chose and devoured the 10"" prime rib cooked perfectly medium rare, charred on the outside, buttery and beefy on the inside with bare bones seasoning. The rest of my group either ordered steak or the fish special and were pleased and stuffed. We couldn't leave without sampling a couple of desserts - It's a totally different stomach! A few plates of berry crisps and apple skillet pie were passed around. Simple yet solid dessert, a perfect ending to a great meal and worth the additional calories. Wildfire is not some new gastronomical adventure but your good old fashion steak house, simple but done right.",N

64159,Q0CFG_Z5l0pewtmWmQ_Qbg,"Dined here last night and had an absolutely excellent time. I am a young diner (still in high school!), from Northwest Indiana. I come to Chicago every few weeks to get my food fix. This trip, I brought along three friends and headed to Graham Elliot. The restaurant was modern, as I expected, and definitely had a quirky and eccentric vibe to it. They even serve the wine in giant Erlenmeyer flasks! The music is great too, and definitely seems to cater to the younger crowd. From what I've read and from my experience, it seems like the staff at Graham Elliot is all very young and clever. Our server certainly was. She was absolutely excellent--perhaps one of the best servers I've ever had. Often, teenagers are treated condescendingly in upscale restaurants such as this one, but she was completely respectful and treated us as she would treat any adults. We obviously aren't of drinking age, which would probably have annoyed some servers, but she offered us ""mocktails,"" which we gladly accepted. Also, one of the diners in our party is sensitive to dairy products, and our waitress really tried to accommodate that to the best of her abilities; even pointing us to a drugstore down the street for Lactaid pills. I really like how they explain the dishes after they have arrived, as I have found great differences between looking at a menu and actually seeing the food in front of me. The restaurant had just rolled out its spring menu about a week prior to our visit, so the fare was lighter. Like I said, we started with mocktails. Between the four of us, we sampled Summertime, Rapper's Delight, and Blueberry Hill, our server's suggestion. While they obviously didn't contain alcohol, the cocktails were light and fresh, containing summery flavors. We really enjoyed them and I'm sure they would be even better with alcohol (not that I have ever tried it...) Oh my gosh, I forgot about the popcorn. Amazing. They definitely have something with this idea, because it was so much more addicting than the usual bread and butter. It was perfectly seasoned, and was refilled as soon as the bottom was visible. We ate about two and half baskets. I would come back for the popcorn alone.We ordered off the regular menu, with each of us selecting a small plate (cold/hot) and a large plate (sea/land). I was lucky to be able to try lots of menu items, because as a group we all tried to order different things. For appetizers, we had the duck satay, carpaccio of beef, caesar salad, and sweetbread hush puppies. I highly recommend the sweetbread hush puppies...great texture and served with a wonderful fennel slaw. I also loved the brioche twinkie--some genius thinking going on there. For our large plates, we sampled the lamb, chicken, salmon, and pork. I didn't get much of the chicken, but I did get to try a bite of the gnocchi that accompanied it, which was one of the best things I tasted all night. The salmon was light and fresh, just as it should be. The pork was served with rhubarb jam and a yam waffle. The combinations are so innovative and modern, and they work. Finally, we ordered all four desserts (chocolate, espresso, strawberry, and pineapple), and shared them. The chocolate, which happened to be our server's suggestion, was the standout. It was served with an apricot jam which complemented the salty chocolate nicely. If you're a fan of unique ice cream/gelato flavors, you'll love the desserts here. They contained lavender, cream cheese, and cardamom flavored ice cream, which were all absolutely creamy and delicious.Graham Elliot gets five stars for its young, quirky atmosphere, extremely kind and attentive waitstaff, and innovative, modern, and delicious dishes. We will be back!",Y
48504,Oyk2u,"I had ordered takeout from here for dinner for me and the bf. We were starving so we went a little overboard. We had ordered 6 pieces of nigiri, 4 rolls, and 2 appetizers all for $80. Yeah...overboard. Delivery took decent amount of time which I guess was good because we got even more hungry for the big feast we were about to get. When we got our order, it seems like we weren't the only ones who thought we went overboard. They gave us 4 pairs of chopstick and a free bottle of sake. Yay to free stuff! What was even more surprising was HOW GOOD the nigiri was. We were really surprised, especially for the price. The sad part is that we just moved and we won't be able to order delivery from here.

24971,YIxooEBOkjj9a7e4I6GIoQ,"This is a tough one.  My food was delicious, but I left with major questions about the restaurant. For background: we were a party of 7, celebrating 2 birthdays.  One person in our party was vegan - not a big deal - she's used to eating out and she doesn't mind what anyone else at the table eats.   Food was tasty.  We got a bunch of appetizers, including saganaki (how can you go wrong??), tiramosalata, tzatziki, garlic potatoes and beets.  I didn't try the beets but the rest were delicious.  For my entree, I did a ""make your own combination"" with 2 half orders - dolmades and spanikopitira.  Both were delicious. Service was spotty at best.  They couldn't get much right.  Brought thigns we didn't order and didn't bring things we did order.  The vegan in our party was told by the server that nothing on the menu could be altered or modified at all (seriously, they can't just leave a sauce off a dish??) so she ended up eating veggie sides for dinner, which was ok but also a bit ridiculous.  Also, while the food came out quickly, the waiters were slow to do anythign else.   And that's where my question lies: food came out very quickly, almost too quickly.  And dishes that can't be modified even just to take off the sauce??  Sounds to me like pre-made meals sitting under a hot lamp waiting to be served.  Maybe they're just really that fast, but I doubt it.  And that knocks them down in my book.  Way better places to go that actually make your food fresh.  Especially for the price.",N

The olive oil they drizzled on the bread was some of the most flavorful I've ever tasted. We were so sad when it was all gone. We had two pizzas, the Salsiccia and a special which had two kinds of prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella. Both were awesome. The crust was crispy and chewy and perfect, and the flavor of the toppings was so spot on. I can't say enough great things about those pizzas.

The five of us loved our nook. We didn't order anything alcoholic, but we thoroughly investigated their other offerings. Three of us had burgers, and the other two ordered some sweet-potato fries to munch on. I was told that the fries were good, and I can personally confirm that the burgers were damn good. They were nothing fancy, but just simple and well-prepared. The gluten-free bun was a great touch. If I'm in the area and hungry, there's a very good chance I'll be stopping by again.",N

Although, the table couldn't fit but more than 2 anyhow. It's really loud here but if you don't mind that, definitely worth a check at least once. I'll be coming back with a group of 4 or less!",N
31176,otiEc8O41zikE7LR4hdgiw,"Well the meal started off ok, good salsa's, fresh chips.  A super yummy complimentary appetizer of this pork stew with beans and a tortilla....then downhill from there.  The service was slow but they were busy and really I wasn't in a hurry so thats ok.  But the most disturbing thing....chedder cheese is used in the cheese enchiladas and nachos, not chihuahua.  That is the kind of bush-league thing i would expect in a Mexican restaurant in bumblefoo Ohio, not in Chicago!  And the food (ordered combination plate) clearly sat under a warming lamp for awhile.  You can totally tell this by the pictures that are posted.   Looks very dry.  The beans were very very greasy.  Refried beans granted are fried, but these glistened and had a flavor of old grease.  I am part Mexican and I know authentic mexican food, this was a mesh of really greasy gross food and some good dishes, so its all in what you order.  I would avoid the combo and go with a more traditional mexican meal like the pork stew or carne asada.  The prices are good.  But I can go to any burrito joint (La Pasadita, Taco Burrito King) and get the same prices, but with better food.",N

All the meat is cooked in butter, so needless to say it was mouth-watering.  Tasting the butter on your tongue though just makes you realize that what you are eating is soooo not good for you.

We had asked if we could have a table to ourselves (they have loooooong community tables).  They said it might take a little longer but they'd try.  It actually didn't take long at all and we were soon sitting in our own little booth with doors that closed us in.  How cute!

Located in Wicker Park, it's sort of the ""bad ass on campus"" from all the streets we saw when traveling here... The one thing I liked a lot about Revolution was it's selection of beers. They have about 6-7 beers home-brewed, which looked AWESOME. My girlfriend and I both had a glass of one, and we enjoyed the taste very much. Cold, filling, and had some great hints of fruit and flavor. The place wasn't too busy (they were actually letting people go home early cus it was so dead when we went).

We were back in Chicago for Memorial Day and the first place we went was Hopleaf to grab a couple drinks and mussels around 4:30p. The front bar area was packed so we asked for a table in the restaurant and were seated upstairs, after arguing with the hostess about whether mussels and drinks constituted ""full service dining"". We waited for almost 20 minutes for the server to take our drink and food order. I thought about leaving, but for old time's sake we wanted to stay. The place was not busy in the restaurant. There were many empty tables, but it still took forever. We finally placed our order and that was the last time we saw our server until she dropped of the check. Thankfully, the bus boy was never too far away to fill up our water and then also bring us more bread for the mussel broth. This place used to be great, but the service sucks and they staff (other than the bus boy) is less than helpful. I definitely won't be back next time I'm in Chicago. It's really gone downhill.",N
66019,t2YMBqZ_rdyE6pK3PjkLRg,Good food and good service.  I went to the Apple Store with my girlfriend and decided to come here always walking by but never checking it out.  A lot of tourists but have to expect that on Michigan. Like to eat at local spots usually but would come back.  They run a good establishment.,Y
49123,S6u,My first Chicago deep dish pizza was Giordano's but I had it in Orlando FL.  I didn't like it.  It was too cheesy.   Now I live next to Giordano and the plan is to order take out there every month.   Spinach and mushroom is yummy but my fiance will not let me order it so we will be having sausage and onion. So what has changed since Orlando?  I don't know but Giordano in Chicago is good.,N
42737,LzEOXxnObnxMlU6VJzEjYw,"I got take out from here last night. We ordered 4 dishes - Spinach Lasagna, Shrimp DeJoghne, Chicken Francese and Meat Ravioli with Meat Sauce. The food was decent enough. Reasonable portions, good flavor but a little overpowering at times. We live in the neighborhood so will probably order again, but it is not a new favorite. I will try dining in soon and re-review.",N
26774,lhxzCtUudORWRF6LzGTunw,"My hubby and I dropped in to Artopolis, pretty much on the whim. We wanted to try something different and weren't really craving anything in particular. This restaurant is located in Greek town. We noticed there were some restaurants that offered free and/or valet parking, this restaurant did not offer parking. But we managed to painlessly find a spot right across the street, and it is fairly inexpensive. Ambiance - is really nice! They have a section upstairs by the windows, which is where we sat. The restaurant gives off an inviting, bright, clean yet cozy feeling. (don't ask how I got all those, its just the feeling I got!) Service - our waitress was friendly, efficient, and was always available or 'around' if we needed anything Food - The food was delicious, we decided to share so we ordered: Spinach And Feta (Spanakopita) which contained fresh spinach leaf, spring onion, dill and feta cheese - this was absolutely yummy and made fresh and flaky! Neptune pizza which had rock shrimp, basil garlic pesto, roma tomato, green onions, mozzarella and crumbled feta - the pizza was good as well, this one is a bit on the cheesy side - and I got full from 2 mid sized slices Side of hummus with bread - the hummus is different than Arabic hummus, but still enjoyable, creamy and made fresh. Now we move on to the BEST part of the dinner - the desserts! O-M-G!!!!! They have a huge selection of baked goodness, which is displayed that it is easy to see the desserts and then pick and choose which oneS you want to order (if you are like me!) The hubby ordered berry cheesecake and I had the tirimasu - both were absolutely heavenly and to YUM! And since I couldn't decide on one dessert...I got one to go (and I think the hubby didn't want to feel left out when I enjoy the dessert at home, so he ordered something too!) We got the Valrhona Chocolate Mousse and a Cannoli to go. And can I say that if and when I go back I wouldn't know which dessert to choose from, because they were all soooo good!!! Its like a taste of mouthwatering heavenly goodness in the form of a dessert in a plate in front of you just waiting to be eaten.",N
13921,HH,Yummmmmmmmmm.  Amazing at brunch and at dinner.  We have had some wonderful empanadas and quesadillas there - they put their own spin on both.  Drinks (mojitos especially) are outstanding.  Plus it's just a nice atmosphere.  Good service too.,N
61290,qCx0IC1mj7WALPmNYX-r5w,I was here about a month ago or so. Their food was great. We ordered butter chicken and some other dishes. It was pricy.. I guess that's the downtown price.,Y
28972,7V3InY6ZU5CeuupnYsFB,"What's not to like?  The food is terrific, they have a great selection of flavors for their bubble teas, and the staff is an all-around class act.  The place is always bustling (definitely a good sign) and you're guaranteed excellent service.  Unqualified recommendation.",N
20036,qVhERIkruZthTq,"Ok...so, when my friend insisted upon meeting me here, I kept thinking ""what dive bar am I going to now....""...See, I was trying to visit a new, supposedly hip spot in Logan Square...but NO....I had to go to the Bad Apple.  Well - I was wrong. The Bad Apple is GOOD.  First of all, it's no dive bar.  It's more of a gastropub - dark wood, a nice long bar and a mix of tables.  There are a ton of beers here - many of which I have never heard of (well, let's face it, I'm more of a wine girl anyway...).  However, I drank beer that night and the bartender suggested something that was really great!  Some sort of IPA - I don't remember what. And the food - surprise!  It's delicious!  Again - I think I put too much stock in the name and the fact that the friend I was there with always insists upon crappy bars...  Anyway, the food is great.  I had a burger that was perfectly cooked with some delicious fries.  There was nothing I could find to complain about in terms of the food. I liked the atmosphere, but I will admit that it gets a bit crowded.  I would have preferred to sit at a table, because in the end, I got smooshed at the bar and then when I got up to go to the bathroom, my friend had to almost fight off someone for my chair (yes, with not only my coat on it, but a full meal in front of it!).   Anyway, aside from the crowd, this place was spot on.  If you want a quiet night, this is probably not the right spot, but for great food, a lively atmosphere and a great beer selection (at reasonable prices), this is a good bet in the area.",N
33048,x2oCd,"dinner last night here was sooo good. cucumber gin gimlet + a selection of the rolls (lobster + kobe beef, salmon in jicama tacos, 2 types of tuna)... definitely fusion but soo good. also i loved that when i told them i was allergic to white tuna (escolar) they were able to easily substitute it with a second type of tuna.",N
19355,bSY,"Mad at myself for not finding this restaurant sooner. I was invited here by a friend, to celebrate her husbands birthday. It was a large party, and we would not be seated until everyone arrived. That was a little bit of a bummer, but we hung out in the huge bar/lounge area and ordered drinks and waited. Once we were escorted into the main dining room and the curtains opened, it was beautiful in the restaurant, so many colors and a huge wine wall. Our party was a total of 12 and we only were given 1 waiter. I figured on a Friday night with that many people we would have more than one waiter. It started off really rocky, the waiter let some people order starters, then when I wanted an appetizer I was told I couldn't order it because she needed more help with our table. It was the strangest thing. I can't be mad at the restaurant for the waiter for making no sense. After a long 45 minutes wait, we had 2 waiters at our table and taking our orders. I ordered a Mojito Smoothie to start and it was really good. For an appetizer I had the Mac n Cheese which is actually a side dish, but It looked better to me than most of their appetizers. I'm glad I ordered it, it was fantastic and I would go back just for that. For my main course I had the Arrachera, Skirt Steak, rice and beans in a chimichurri sauce. The dish was full of flavor. I think our waiter was just having a bad day and I don't want to base my review on just the service alone, because the food definitely made up for it. My friends and I noticed that a group of girls behind us, got delivered a huge ball of Cotton Candy in a Vase filled with Carmel Corn. We did not see this on the dessert menu and asked, how do we get one of those? Sure enough they make Cotton Candy, it's just not on the menu. For $9 to split between a table of 12 wasn't a bad price at all. It was a fun night out and I can't wait to go back with a smaller group, hoping the service will be better.",N
28899,iRVNwo6-pJURnSYV7Ksu-w,"I wasn't impressed at all, overpriced and tables too close together, tables were a cluster, had one customer arguing with another and threatening him. The bus boy was a ten times better and more attentive than the server!!! wouldn't recommend and will not go again. The music was great though!!! The food tasted great but for 50 dollars I expected more than just half a scallop!!!! I left smelling like I cooked in a kitchen!!!",N

53362,KWe3gb7iYi,"Publican is a unique experience that tries hard but doesn't deliver. I really had a hard time deciding on the star rating because part of my issue with Publican is personal preference vs. failing to deliver. Bottom line, I wasn't overly impressed and probably won't be back. Background: Dinner, 7:45 on a Tuesday night Food: The quality of the food is, for the most part, good. However, the menu selection leaves a bit to be desired. Basically, the menu is set up as ""Tapas Plus:"" larger than tapas, but not a meal in and of itself. Here is a rundown of what my friend and I shared:     Chef's choice oysters - good selection, good flavor...but then again    oysters don't require cooking.     Daily Pickle plate - bread and butter pickles with some pickled vegetables as well. I really like pickled foods...but really didn't like this these items, simply based on flavor.     Trio of Hams - delicious thinly sliced hams. One of the best items we tried.     Steak Tartare - A  steak tartare, what can I say. It was fine.     Boudin Blanc - The best item we had - deliciously seasoned. Beer:     Ohhhh the beer. They have a very substantial beer list. Luckily, they also have a very knowledgeable ""beer expert"" that can help you pair with what you are eating. The Saison with the oysters was a good call. Service: This is where the bottom fell out. Our server was HORRIBLE. He greeted us promptly, but then we said we need just a minute to look at the beer list he left us for 15 minutes before returning. When we asked him about popular items and to describe a few things he acted like it was a huge inconvenience. After the first round of beers our glasses sat empty for a good 10-15 minutes before he checked back. We actually started ordering from the food runners because they seemed to care more than our server and checked back. The server dropped off the check and then proceeded to go to the host stand and chit-chat for 10 minutes. This is was when I finally, got up, tracked down a manager and complained. It takes a LOT for me to get up and complain out a server. The manager listened intently and apologized for the inconvenience. Cost: It's billed as a high end restaurant, it's not cheap. I didn't think it delivered an experience or food aligned to the prices. 12 oz bottles of beer run from $5 up to $20.  The food was somewhat overpriced for the portion and quality. Other considerations: The one cool thing Publican has going for it is the concept behind the restaurant - communal beer house. Big communal tables can be fun if you're in the right mind set, as can the booths that have doors on them. Definitely not the spot for a quite date, but a unique experience none the less.",N
11331,fLIlhwXWjgXpOBAgq1sc7w,"It's fine, but for me not worth the wait.  Ordered a ""red"" pepperoni and it was rather forgettable.  Very basic, hit the spot, but certainly I've had better. Service was quite spotty, had to flag down the server a few times, and waited forever to get the check.",N
59525,JrDj_QWiBYDQOPgoB5SOQw,"WAY too much salt! I ate there hours ago and am still dehydrated. It's also overpirced for what you get. And the wait in ridiculous for what the food is. Overall, we were not inspired by the meal and were very dissapointed.",Y

I've only been twice but that's clearly not enough for this girl because I've caught myslef day dreaming about their orange french toast more than once. I had an omelette with avocado and bacon the first time and that was nummers but that orange french toast is so decadent and rich that I contemplated ordering another one to go. I took my mom here on one of these visits and she loved it even more, probably because she lives in Justice. If she were a Yelper she'd want to give Yolk six stars if she could. Just joshing, I love the citizens of Justice even if there are no places to sit down and have a meal. I digress. In closing, Yolk is delicious inside and out and I can't wait to go back.

I was definitely happy with the selection and ended up having a couple of drafts that I hadn't tasted yet. I started out with a Hop Stoopid from Lagunitas:  had this in bottles but never on tap, it was quite satisfying. After that I moved on to the incredibly delicious Imperial IPA from Avery Brewing in Colorado. My only complaint is that they served this in a half pint because of the ABV.. Whatever. The place was packed and had a great atmosphere. A little on the pricey side but I think this is normal for good beer when you're not in the NW.

He got the bacon-wrapped meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  Big portion, tasty meat, but nothing stellar.  It was something we could have made at home. Drinks were strong -- the Triple Salchow was sweet and syrupy, but delicious.  Our table was in the back of the restaurant, butting up against all their music equipment...not exactly nice to look at.  Lots of parking nearby, and no wait (although we were the early birds there at 5:30pm on a Friday).

Just exquisite. - It's pricey. Yeah. I work hard for my money and I couldn't imagine anything else I'd want to spend it on. - Pay attention to the small things.

We're looking forward to going back, especially during a busier night when they (appear to) have live music.

Some things maybe you should get two bites worth: the mushrooms with the feta dressing, the asparagus, the pineapples, and the potato salad in particular. Oh, and the homemade mozzarella. So, so unbelievable. My friends who are meativores really enjoyed everything... I tried some scallops and some catfish-- both were phenomenal, and this is coming from someone who's mostly lost the ability to taste differences in meat and seafood. Zed451 brought all of my palate back in one evening. Their cocktails are fantastic and inventive, especially the cranberry old fashioned (the bourbon lemonade is great too). The service is unbeatable-- the (sous-)chefs who present the meats really do make them in the kitchen! And their pastry chef deserves awards... Try their peanut butter and jelly ice cream. Even if you don't have room, this is impossible to regret. Everyone here is impossibly friendly and knowledgeable and good at what they do... They even made me a special tofu and vegetable skewer when I was just planning to indulge without remorse on the harvest table.

At our dinning table to feast on this cake were the harshest critics on earth: both of my grandmothers. I have to admit that when we sat down to eat it we were all worried that the fondant wouldn't taste very good and that the black coloring would give the icing a bitter flavor. Much to our shock this cake tasted even better than it looked. Everyone had a second piece. There was a lot of moaning and eyes rolling into the back of heads.

What I didn't like so much:  fishy-greasy smell when we walked in.  And overall, several preparations were too salty for my taste.  I was ready to love everything.  But as the evening progressed, I didn't have that blissful ""yum - bring it on"" feeling.  There were too many fried onion slivers as well.  And one dish had a melted butter ball in a clear wrapper - like one of those bath beads you drop in the tub to dissolve -- except this one came with a warning to puncture it carefully so as to not be sprayed with hot butter.  Hmm, dangerous food; interesting. What I liked:  attentive service; comfy chairs (important because you want to spend hours enjoying the meal).  The freedom of not looking at a menu - letting the chef decide what to serve.  Amazing creativity in both food and serving pieces.  Beautiful presentations (the people at the table next to us were snapping photos).  A wine pairing that complemented the food and let us try interesting varietals and vintages. Considering the complexity of the food, it's too bad that saltiness stands out for me.  Although there was a new dish based on rhubarb that was gloriously pinky-red and fun (I skipped the onions).   The dishes were beautiful works of modern art.  So I'm wondering--is it possible to be so complex that something gets lost?  Like using all the colors in the palette and ending up with gray?  I'm glad I went to Alinea.  I'll always remember the unique presentations and the fun evening with my family.  If I'm looking for purely delicious though, I'll choose Tru or Trotters.",N

Our meal was overpriced (over $300 for party of 6) & skimpy. Worse yet, the food was very unauthentic (i.e., Americanized). It's so ironic because we had wonderful, reasonably-priced Mexican & Latin American food on the same trip at Loteria Grill in Los Angeles and at Nacional 27 in Chicago. They are everything that Frontera Grill should have been but was not. My advice--pass this place by & try a place with better food & reasonable prices (Nacional 27, Tango Sur or Rosebud on Rush).",Y

2896,0vztl43pLbd-1rYw2I-WcA,"Over two years after we first dinned here. we decided to come back and celebrate my birthday. I think after all the other dinning experiences we've had in the past two years, I really wanted to try Tru again and see where it stands when compared to other Michelin starred restaurants. By the minute we walked in, they treated you as if you were the only customers and all attention was on you. And it's my birthday, so everyone said happy birthday to me, which made the birthday girl really happy :). The service was top notch, I always appreciate the attentions to details--black napkin for my black dress, purse stool next to my feet, and the happy birthday print on the menu. We went for the Chef's collection, plus some caviar. Needless to say, every course's presentation was beautiful. -Caviar: it has the most memorable presentation as the caviar was presented on some gorgeous white coral. We are rookies when it comes to caviar, so all I can say is, it's YUMMY! :) -White sturgeon ""caviar"", rested on avocado. This chef's take on caviar is just as delicious as the real caviar we just had, if not better. I think the avocado made it. -Day boat scallop: it had a very profound Asian flavor to it, i think it's the ginger and thai chili. This was the start of this underlying Asian flavor of tonight's dinner. -Summer tomato salad: refreshing, summery, and it preserves the natural flavors of tomatoes while made it more visually appealing. It made me feel less guilty about going out because I was eating all the vitamins! -Dashi flan: i think this might be the least memorable dish of all night. I don't remember what it is... -Foral artichoke: it was some artichoke creamy soup with edible flowers on top. The flavors were amazing, and the presentation was pretty. Loved it! -Alaskan halibut: another dish with more of an Asian twist than French in my mind. It tasted like a Thai halibut curry. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, but I thought Tru is supposed to be more like modern French? I still remember the foie gras ravioli we had at our first visit. Now they went for Thai flavors? -Jidori chicken: very tender, and had foie gras and black truffle shaving. It was the high note of the night. But again, I think there's some soy sauce-ish tasting sauce on the plate. A little odd to couple that with foie gras, but oh well, I loved their chicken. Then comes the cheese cart, then the vanilla parfait and banana ice cream presented by ""George"", some monkey statue that made me laugh. It's kinda weird to present dessert on a monkey statue, maybe another hint of the thai underlying tone? Last but not least is the dessert cart, I asked for one of each, a girl can never have too many desserts! When we left, they gave us each a treat to take home. Very thoughtful and a nice touch for an amazing dinner!  It's definitely worth a Michelin Star, and we will definitely be back again!",N

Sometimes it can take a while to get your order placed but I tend to like this quality. For this reason it's a nice place to go on a date or to catch up with friends. Plus, the food is really amazing.  I've tried a lot of different menu options and I love everything from chips and salsa to tacos, burritos, and the carne asada.

We got there at 12:30 and luckily there was a line inside but it was all indoors. The service was great, they managed the line well and Rick showed up and helped coordinate staff and check in on things. It was nice to see that despite all the recent attention he is still present in all of his establishments. The food is FANTASTIC and the prices are reasonable, allowing a Rick Bayless experience for the masses. It was a good thing we had to wait in line for 15 minutes, because it took us all that time to decide what to order. I wanted one of everything. We had the chips and guacamole to start and then we spilt the Jamon and Pepito tortas. Both were excellent, but I preferred the Jamon torta. We then had churros to finish. Despite the counter ordering, they let you wait until after your meal to ask for the churros so that they come out fresh--a nice touch to a casual establishment. I'm not the hugest fan of communal dining. We sat at a table with four people who appeared to have nothing to talk about as they listened to our conversation for most of the meal, which isn't entirely pleasant. I'm dying to go back.

The short review: It was the best parts of a Little Buddha without the pretense or prices. We started with a pair of specialty drinks and gyoza. The drinks were really good, and the one on special was almost affordable. The gyoza was better than most I've had, which id saying something because it's always good. We had a mix of traditional and specialty rolls, including both that were discounted that night. My liberal guilt of over-fishing kept us from buying any tuna, even though it was staring at me through the counter. Everything was on-par with what you'd expect from a quality sushi restaurant. The one stand-out, in both name and flavor, was the Yo La Mango.  Judging by the tables around us, I wasn't the only one announcing my indie-creds. We sat at the counter, but it wasn't the chatty experience you sometimes get. The chefs had their heads in the work, but were still nice enough to show us the rolls before they went out. Even if the meal didn't blow me away, we both had such a great time it deserves 5 stars. Everything just worked.",N
29478,t6RSWFYiO3fUioaTtcF1jA,"I don't know what else I can say that'll change the existing compliments. Not hype at all, but this is definitely a special occasion type of restaurant so be ready to foot the bill, not only for the food but the wine. Servers and hosts are attentive and knowledgeable, quick to answer any questions and requests. And yes, plates are small, as with all restaurants of this caliber. These are not meant to be scarfed down, homies. You are not at ma's diner. These are tastings. This is refined dining. Think and eat, think and eat. APPRECIATE. There is a place and time for meals that'll add 3 inches to your waistline. The menu is divided into Cold and Hot (starters) and Sea and Land (main courses). No worries, there's a dessert menu, too for other sweet toothers like myself. Truffle popcorn is complimentary and delicious, as a few other complimentary chef selection's throughout the meal, which depends on the night you go, season, etc. My personal favorite was the take on American pie: in one bite of cheese, cinnamon tuile, and apple gelee I transformed into a giggly 10 y.o. eating my pop's pies. Personally I didn't want to opt for the prix-fixe. I don't think it's a ""must"" unless you're not used to how certain tastes go together, in which you may need a little helping hand to guide you... completely understandable. As for me, I wanted to pick things to my liking, and it would've rounded out to about the same price anyway. As far as the complaints about the entire table participation for the tasting menu, this is not the first restaurant in the world to do this, yet alone Chicago. Highlights: Hog cheek with hominy spaetzle, vidalia onion, dandelion green, pork rind. Heirloom duck with jerusalem artichoke, nappa cabbage, toast powder, apple butter.",N

55617,0yVwu,"What a difference a few months make. Obviously, Big Jones has taken a lot of the criticism on this site to heart, because my second experience at this Southern Coastal Cuisine spot reversed all of my sad experiences with everything on the line: brunch with the IN LAWS! I've been meaning to go back and give Big Jones a second shot. I had hoped that the flops of my initial experience would just amount to kinks of a new establishment, I am thrilled to admit that they have been worked out! Sure, I was in for brunch, but what I experienced the second time around was an entirely perfect dining experience, full of exciting and unique menu options, perfect preparation and brilliant service! Beignets are as advertised: light, moist, buttery and sweet. Cocktails are refreshing and unique--a greyhound cooler was the perfect post-party remedy. Sharers rejoice! A very diverse menu offers savory new-school takes on Southern Comfort food, incorporating spicy, buttery and fresh into every bite. It is only with friends that you can dig that fork into the many options that seemed to be prepared to perfection all around us. My Eggs Rochambeau were addicting and likely horrible for me. Sirloin slices were rare and juicy, sitting above some of the best potato pancakes I've ever had..better than my mom's latkes! The Tasso ham & cheese sandwich is delicious, perfectly crispy and rich. Those damned fried onions, potatoes and okra with a zippy cream dipping sauce are awesome! My mother-in-law's fried green tomato BLT was the perfect combination of tangy, salty, crispy and creamy. Seriously, I don't think I stopped eating, whether it be off of my own plate or someone else's. I trashed the grits in my last review. I loooooove grits. I am so excited at how nicely prepared the cheese grits were this time around. Perfect! Creamy, cheesy, buttery, damn! A little hot sauce on top and you have a knockout compliment, as if one was necessary. I'm such a pig, I ordered them as a side. I'm very glad I did. Service has a taken a huge leap forward. Our server was bubbly, gracious and happy to have us. Front staff were incredibly polite and offered happy waves to us on our way out. I would highly recommend Big Jones for brunch. A combination of unique offerings, great hangover cocktails and friendly service make it the perfect place to take in a slow Sunday morning. The flavors and people will be sure to brighten your day. I'll be back soon to try dinner again. Welcome to Andersonville, Big Jones!",N
41751,weel91hgnlMKBVojOM5dZw,"The Hopleaf is another place in the city that has an amazing atmosphere. The first time I came here was with my roommate and his parents the day after Thanksgiving. It was a great night to be in the city as the Christmas atmosphere was starting to ring in. When you walk in the door you enter the bar which I haven't really experienced yet as I have only come here for the food. You have to walk through the bar to get to the restaurant part. There are two levels of the restaurant. I love the top balcony because it overlooks the level below and you can hear the chatter below but it isn't disturbing. Again this place is very comfortable, I could sit here for hours and just eat and talk. Food = Amazing. Huge beer and wine list. I loved the sausage plate. Four kinds of sausage and pancetta with white baked beans. I ordered the steak and frites. It was very similar to the steak and frites and had when I was in Poland only the frites come with aioli. Which is probably one of the best things ever. Frites and aioli for days. So good. The mussels here are very good. Two kinds: Belgian and then they usually have a mussels special that changes. I talked about this in my Publican review. The mussels here are very good. Nothing to scoff at but again I would say the mussels at the Publican are better. However if I was going out strictly on atmosphere to get mussels I would choose Hopleaf. This is a great place to bring friends because if there is a wait you can just sit at the bar and enjoy the giant selection of beer/wine. It is sort of out of the way, a bit north, but it is worth the journey as you will leave happy.",N
39149,Y1iBpglhV7tbZb621lN7eg,"It's an invasion! I was at Sun Wah today with my mom and brother, who were visiting from Michigan, and it was packed - oddly enough, with white people (they weren't scared by the ducks hanging in front?) who had made reservations (you can do that there?). I've been going to Sun Wah for years and had never seen it so full of white people - it's not the most well-decorated place, and it's certainly off the beaten path unless you're Asian to begin with. I'd also never seen anyone bring wine in there (apparently you can BYOB, another thing I'd never have guessed since they do carry a variety of bottled beers). We found out from our server (who is one of the family members that owns the restaurant) that Sun Wah was featured in the Tribune for Peking duck. It was a good write up - no wonder so many people were there. All joking aside, I'm glad that the best place to get roast duck in Chicago is getting some attention. Check it out, and try a few things you normally wouldn't - I've gone through a fair amount of the menu, which features fantastic, authentic dishes for an extremely reasonable price, and as far as I can tell, everything is good.",N
53410,p9vvUjE-EGPU4VzaxmhDWA,"This place is the pork love of my life. I've been to The Publican twice now and it just seems to be getting better. I've sat in an enclosed booth and at a freestanding table for two and found both just fine. The service both times was impeccable. It was my boyfriend's birthday the second time we went and were greeted with a ""Happy birthday"" and a candle on our waffle at the end of the meal. I love the design of their menu, and everything I've ordered has not only met, but far exceeded my expectations. I've eaten in a lot of great restaurants all over the world and the food at the Publican stands up to the best. They have, hands down, the best pork I've ever had anywhere. My boyfriend, who has worked in the industry for years and really knows his beer, was really impressed with their beer selection, and I found a delicious French cider I fell in love with. Dishes of note: the potted rillettes (divine) the ham chop in hay (really big, made for sharing, and fantastic) and the lamb sausage (incredible flavor). For those who complain about the noise level, yes, it's loud in there. But you need to consider the concept of the restaurant- it's not supposed to be a quiet, intimate place. The communal seating punctuates that idea well. It's a place to kick back, have some delicious beer and even better food and maybe meet a few new people. If you're looking for romantic and intimate you may want to choose somewhere else, but I think the Publican has perfectly achieved what they wanted to do. They really know what they're doing over there, and I can't wait to go back again.",N

When in November with anticipation, I heard from Schwa to confirm my reservation, And breathless I was, Until they canceled and killed ma buzz. When in December I was supposed to go, To Schwa restaurant, this time fo' sho, But they canceled again, And boy, I felt hopeless then. When in January I finally did eat, The beauty, the wonders, of a Schwa feast, The friendly chefs, Did pick up the check. ** Disclaimer: I am not a poet.  As if you couldn't tell already. The actual review: Just got back from Schwa, and IT. WAS. AMAZING.  If my poem was unintelligible, here's the skinny: I got two reservations and got both canceled (the first res was on my 6th anniversary!!!), the restaurant actually got me a new reservation and picked up the tab.  Talk about awesome. The food: Incredible.  Our menu: amuse (oyster shooter), crab (peekytoe crab w/ pine, mushroom, caramelized plantain), apple pie soup (savory), tagliatelle (with huckleberries, black truffle, and diced veal heart), maki (with green curry, rootbear, and awesome little fried roe on top), bonus quail egg ravioli, tiger fish (w/ carrot, marshmallow, cardomon), biscuits and gravy (w/ sweetbreads, gravy and mustard), pork (with zucchini, garlic chips, and white anchovy sauce), a cheese puff, a celery-based cake with white chocolate side, and a bonus dessert of violet-infused cones w/ white choco foam, beet ice cream, and a peppercorn. The food review: The bad: some things seemed a bit over-salted.  But I have kind of a weird relationship with salt--I tend to think things are either over-salted or not salty at all, so um, take my salt eval w/ a grain of salt?! The good: EVERYTHING.  The pork was unexpectedly phenomenal.  I could eat that stuff all day.  The quail egg was, duh, amazing.  The maki was unexpectedly phenomenal--who thinks to fry roe?!  It was fantastically crunchy and added amazing interest.  I can't really tell you anything about the food that people haven't said a thousand times over (it's amazing, creative, how do they think of this stuff, the breadth of their talent is incredible, blah blah), but I can tell you that my incredibly picky dinner companion (seriously, his favorite restaurant is Chipotle, and until he got to college, he pretty much only ate chicken, spaghetti, pancakes, burgers and pizza--no joke) LOVED the meal and called it ""the best meal of his life.""  So, for those of you who, like me, often live/eat with incredibly picky eats, fear not!  If my picky eater loved it, yours probably will too. The service: Not sure what everyone means by ""curt service,"" etc.  I thought the service was phenom.  Seth was our main person, and he was thorough, efficiently, and friendly.  They let us try some of their own stash of beer, gave us two freebie dishes, and were super apologetic about the prior cancellations (even though we were more than happy to be there!).  They picked up the check without us even mentioning anything about the prior cancellations, which was awesome.  The chef popped by our table several times to ask us about the food (including the new biscuits and gravy--first night on the menu) and was very nice.  Overall, some of the best service I've ever had (and very low-key, not in-your-face, not overly chatty--really perfect).   The atmosphere: I actually thought it was fantastic. A nice space, and I thought the dim lighting and interesting music (aka not soft boring faux-classy stuff) made it laid-back and romantic.  The low-key atmosphere made it so much easier to enjoy the food--no pretension! In conclusion: PLEASE go.  Well, actually, please don't go, so it'll be easier for me to get reservations.  Kthxbai.",N

It took a few minutes but we each found what we were looking for. First, we were given a lovely salad with a mustard vinaigrette, quickly followed by Geja's famous cheese fondue. This was my first time doing the fondue thing and it was AWESOME! Next, they bring out this tray covered in fresh vegetables & a variety of seafood (shrimp, scallops & lobster). This was the sweetest shrimp that I have ever tasted, the scallops literally melted in your mouth & one can NEVER go wrong with LOBSTER. As if all of that wasn't enough, they bring a pot of flaming chocolate to your table with pound cake, strawberries & marshmallows for dipping. WOW!!

46485,MjdRq5H3dzAbuJJ6m3OODg,"This is my first yelp review ever, and I knew I had to pick a Chicago business that was worthy of my inagural review. Hands-down, it is Art of Pizza. My first year living in Chicago I lived 1/2 a block west of Art on Nelson. After my roommates' Dad and my Dad graciously moved us in they got Art of Pizza slices for a hearty thank you lunch. All 4 of us have been obsessed with it ever since. I'm talking the deep dish here. The crust is buttery and crispy, but not so hard that it will scrape your mouth. The sauce is exquisite with ripe tomatoes and wonderful seasoning and spices. The toppings, whether spinach and mushroom or sausage are always plentiful and in perfect compliment to the cheese that tops the pie. It's hard to explain how good this stuff actually is. If you order for delivery, be prepared for an hour wait, and more on the weekends. Just sit still, or go take a walk, and enjoy the anticipation because it is SO worth it. I've never had a pizza from Art delivered anything but piping hot. On the other hand, if you need a quick, nourishing, delicious lunch or dinner stop in in for one of the many slices they keep ready. So good, so cheap, a slice and a pop costs around $4. And you won't be hungry for hours after. The guys who works at the front counter is always there, and he's so cheerful and awesome and I swear he remembers me when I come in.

43626,UZc4W2zxBzCHmHA8V5VfMw,"**Edit**: Wow. I'm getting hate mail for posting a 1 star review and expecting to eat within 2.5 hours of entering an establishment. Really? Drea C., you can think I'm a ""dumb b*tch"", but really I was just stating my experience. Not expecting to be ""treated like a king"". My review below is fair and accurate. THAT being said, the owner also KINDLY emailed me, recalled the situation, apologized for the situation and asked if he could rectify the situation, so I am bumping this up to 2 stars due to fine customer service after the fact. If I ever decide to go back, I will definitely let you all know how it is. Even you, Drea C. Original review below...** We did everything right. We knew attempting to go to a new, neighborhood gastropub on the Saturday night of its opening week would come along with a wait. So we called ahead and they assured us it haven't been more than a 45 minutes wait so far. I also found a blog with a review stating that they'll take your phone number and call you when your table is ready anyway...perfect. Our party of 4 arrived around 8pm and was told we had an hour wait, gave them our phone number and went two doors down to El Cid Tacos for a drink. Two margaritas too many we realized it had been about 1.5 hours with no call, so we closed our tab and walked over there thinking our table had to be within a drink away. We checked back in at Longman & Eagle and were told that we were the next 4 top to be seated as soon as two 2 tops could be squeezed together. We crammed in and ordered another drink from their bar where we waited 30 MORE minutes (2 hours at this point) until we saw a beacon of hope... a 4 top was paying their bill! We cashed out with our cocktail waitress, hovered over the table while it was cleaned and what did the hostess do at this point? SEAT ANOTHER PARTY OF 4 INSTEAD. Right in front of our face! I tapped her shoulder in disbelief and said, ""You showed me the list and told us we were the next 4-top, we have been waiting over 2 hours, when you said it would be one, I think you are mistaken and this is our table."" She swiftly said, ""Nope they are first"" and walked back to her station. At this point we each set our almost finished drinks at the hostess station and left. It didn't seem like they minded if they lost our business or not, but this will go down as the worst restaurant at which I've never ate. In the end, their lack of regard or apology for their oversight was what was most alarming when they are trying to make nice in the new neighborhood. Other reviewers that were lucky enough to get a seat seemed to like it, but to me this place was just complete snobbery in a flannel facade. FYI: I'm a carnivore, but to my vegetarian friends out there, from staring at their menu during our long wait I noticed that even their meat-free (fries) and seafood options state that they are cooked in animal fats or plated with meat as well. Again, wouldn't bother me, but might bother some.",N
24674,f8jYJggaZl0VhFz-wi36rg,"Excellent food, horrible service. The DMV has better service than they do. Typically, when you go into a restaurant, you're asked if you want drinks and if you decline, some sort of beverage is brought out to you, typically being water. My entire lunch here went without anything to drink besides the oolong tea they serve every table, which is piping hot. I had ordered a Coke only to discover they were out and so I changed the order to a Sprite. I'm guessing they were out of this as 10 minutes later, two of the waiters walked in with 10 cases of an assortment of Coke products. Apparently, they forgot I ordered drinks. Giving them a few minutes, I flagged down a waiter. Asking him for a soda yielded the response, ""Please ask your waiter for it."" To which the only thing I can think of is, ""YOU ARE THE WAITER!"" Beverage issue aside, when you come in for lunch, you SHOULD get the Lunch Menu, but they give you the dinner menu. You have to specifically ask for a lunch menu or else your bill will be closer to $40 instead of $20. And to get this, I had to wait another 10-15 minutes because I'm guessing the waiter did not understand which menu I was referring to or even what a a menu is.

It's what I like to call ART FOOD. I'm not much for art food. It was beautiful, and almost everything tasted ok. Nothing wowed we with taste. It's like presentation over shadows the taste so you kind of forget the food is just good at best. There was a lot of gelatin going on.

Also, the food was salty and just not very good.  The concept of Zed451 compared to all the other brazilian steakhouses is that the actual line cook/or ""chef"" comes to your table to serve the meat/fish/etc.  however, everytime they would approach the table i felt they they were trying to hard to sell their dish.

Don't even try to elbow your way to the bar thinking you can get a drink while you wait because it's like taking the ""L"" red line at 5:30pm on a weekday. I suggest you go to the nearby restaurants for a drink while waiting for the hostess to call you. That being said, since you can get a drink at the surrounding near empty restaurants, it says something about the packed crowd at Longman and Eagle. After being seated at 9pm, I noticed the lofty and rustic feel to the restaurant and felt like I was in a barnhouse...in a good way! I thought our waitress would be overwhelmed because we were probably her 7th table of the day, but she greeted us cheerfully and took her time explaining the menu to us. The beer and whiskey list is extensive and I settled for something that had the word ""grass"" in it. Although it was a bit too lawnmower like for me, it was indeed the unique kind of beer that's hard to find elsewhere. Between 5 girls, we ordered the slow roasted cauliflower, pork belly, seared scallops, roasted beet salad and cheese selection. We enjoyed every single dish and I also took note that small plates restaurants usually put too much salt in the food; in the case of L&E,, everything was done just right.

14171,PZxW44eM8hX6lwrvwb5m2w,"2 1/2 really. The worst of the three Brazillain steakhouses I've been to.  A common trick for buffet restaurants is to oversalt the food so you get thirsty and fill up on water.  I expect this everywhere but this place took it over the top!  EVERYTHING was EXTREMELY SALTY, the meats and the salad bar offerings.  I had to spit out the sausage it was inedible! The salad bar was very limited on top of it.  The service was the best but doesn't make up for the food.  The little pop overs are perfect!  But I will never go back when I know Fogo or Brazzas is much better.",N

The Asparagus Gold appetizer, with the shrimp and bit of bacon, is tasty if a little naughty. My vegetarian friends love this place, too. My only complaint is with the service. While everyone is extremely nice, something has been missed or confused every time I've been to Indie. The mistakes are always corrected and I've never been over-charged, but be aware that you may have language issues with the servers. Just double-check your order, and everything should be fine.",N
48408,eos0NUxTAEGTkZ8Lz71yLQ,"I'm really suprised by the great reviews for this place. My experience was awful. My husband and I have a running joke - after trying ""someplace new"" one night and being really dissapointed we started reminding each other ""when we want to try someplace new, we should try someplace old"". I finally figured out that for us, it really does apply to sushi in Chicago. We adore Toro - yeah the wait can be long but we have never spent more that $40 for a ton of food and it is always amazing. We should have just gone back there instead of trying Wakamono. We were seated immediately for an early weekend dinner. Our waitress gave us plastic cups for our wine - classssy! - and brought us some tasty nibbles. Sadly, these were the BEST part of the meal. The jalepeno miso was nothing special and it only had two small pieces of tofu, which is my favorite part. Our rolls were awful - the salmon roll was falling apart when it reached the table and the pieces of fish it in were disgustingly huge. Okay, I like raw fish, but I don't want a 3 ounce piece of it in my mouth with no rice. I shouldn't have to unhinged my jaw to get a giant piece of sushi roll into my mouth, only to find out I am now left with a huge gob of raw fish in it. Like I said, I eat sushi (both rolls and nigiri) so it's not like I don't like the taste of raw fish, but I actually gagged three times before I managed to swallow that beast. For the quality of the sushi (horrible) this place is way overpriced. But then again, I wouldn't come back if you paid me.",N

The menu is inventive, offering dishes from rabbit hash, to Caesar omelets, sturgeon lox platter, and lamb eggs Benedict.  I opted for the latter.  The lamb was extremely flavorful; very tender and more on the shredded side.  It was served with leeks and fresh green beans which together tasted like a green bean casserole.  It was served on top of what I can best describe as lightly fried croquette filled with a green pea compote.  It was topped with one poached egg and mint leaves.   The service was excellent and very friendly.  I was the first to arrive of our party.  I was greeted with nothing but smiles and bright attitudes.  I cannot wait to return for dinner.",N
18768,BdN9TmNK-Y,"I was dying to go to this place for months after passing it on 90/94 multiple times and hearing great reviews from friends. The restaurant is a little pricey so I saved it for a special occasion, my birthday. Between drinks, appetizers and food (very small portions by the way) the bill was about $130 for two people before tip. The food was tasty but didn't live up to my high expectations. If based on the food alone, I might give the place 4 stars, but it is way overpriced and definitely has an air of pretension when you walk in the door. Also the place was really crowded, and it felt like we were sitting on top of our fellow diners. Not the best place for a romantic date but probably more fun for a group. I'm not running back to this place any time soon, especially when there are so many other great and affordable Latino fusion restaurants in Chicago.",N

The second time, I came here to watch my friend's father's mambo band perform for Carnivale's anniversary (shout-out to Angel Melendez and the 9-1-1 Mambo Orchestra!).  I didn't eat this time but the margaritas were great. Try the mango margarita -- it's delicious! The third time I came here was Friday, May 4. Two of my bosses took me here for staff appreciation week. OH MAN! Do they know how to appreciate me or what! I had a jibarito and it was to die for. The plantain was crispy but not too tough, the steak couldn't have been any more perfect, and the side salad next to it was great. I have no idea what kinda dressing they put on there (maybe something of the balsamic persuation?) but it was tasty. :) The decor is great. It's so bright and colorful, but it's not obnoxious. While lunch was a great time to go, dinner is better. Sometimes there is live music and the atmophere is just overall ALIVE and exciting. Waitstaff has always been friendly and prompt.

Excited, me and a pal decided to meet up for dinner at Texas de Brazil and see what all this Brazilian steakhouse eating was all about. I waited in the lounge where I saw an argument between staff about matches and where matches were located which I thought kind of odd. The thing that really bugged me was the loud screeching front door that made an insane wail every time it opened. The lounge area itself was quite swank with nice lights and some wicker stuff. The hostess let me know that when my friend arrived we could come back to the front. My friend arrived and we were seated on the first floor with white cloth tables and there was plenty of chatter and bustle going on upstairs. We went to hit up the buffet and found great meats, salads, soups, and veggies. I took favor with the seasoned cold shrimp which fit perfectly well in my lobster bisque! The potato dishes were pretty good but I liked the mashed potatoes that greeted us when we came back and fried plantains. The big buffet really reminded me of a Las Vegas style buffet with the good food, fancy pots, and high quality food. Let's turn the token GREEN! In came sausage, duck, pork chops, parmesan crusted meats, oh man. RED! The bumrush of servers with big skewers of meat halted and we were amazed at the meats on the plate. I bit into flank steak, carved through chicken, and ate some meat lollipops. We sipped on beers and just kept going at the food.  GREEN! In came lamb, then there was this big steak my friend saw flying around and commanded for ""the big one that looks like a tire!"" and they hooked it up medium rare. The food was terrific albeit after awhile much too salty for my tastes. I probably should have gotten some sauces, but the meat was of good texture on the outside and tender on the in. We could have made a three hour meal of it all but settled in on a much more abbreviated feast as we were unable to breathe! After the delicious eats, we headed our for a 2 mile walk to get our senses back!",N

I'm honestly less enamored with the thin crust pizza, but I'm not sure why anyone would come to Pequod's and get the thin crust pizza...  I feel the same way about the appetizers, but, again, if you're ruining your appetite for pizza on the appetizers that's, like, your choice, man.

I stuck with the chicken breast and parmesan, both of which were very good. The best part is the unlimited supply of garlic mashed potatoes and fried bananas. The ambiance was wonderful.

Two of these have egg whites in them and I was very nervous about ordering them. The waitress assured me that if I didn't like it she would bring me a different one. But I ended up really liking them. In fact I couldn't even feel the smell of the egg whites. They probably use the egg whites to give it a nice frothy texture. They use a variety of bitters in their cocktails and its good because bitter as taste is very misunderstood. When used wisely they can really open up and bring out the other flavors very well.

I LOVE southern cooking and I know good food and Big Jones has neither.  First, I should have been cautious when I walked in to find that the premise of the place is upscale-soul food.  Typically if the food is any good, then the words ""upscale"" and ""soul food"" don't belong in the same sentence. I started with the gumbo ya-ya, the waitress cautioned me that it was a unique gumbo since it was made with a ""dark roux"".  When it came to the table, she was right, it was very dark, but what she failed to inform me of was the dirt-like taste!  Yuck!  I forced down two bites and couldn't finish it.  When the waitress returned to check on me she asked if I wanted it to go, to which I replied a very quick ""No"".  We then discussed how it was not my idea of gumbo and she obliged by taking it off the bill (appreciated that).  For my entree I had the savannah catfish and grits, it looked amazing until I bit into the fish only to find that there was absolutely no seasoning on it - not even salt!  Finally, I thought let me end this meal on a good note with some dessert, so I got the peanut gooey butter cake that is served with coffee crunch.  The cake was o-k, but the accompanying coffee crunch was a house made toffee that wasn't coffee flavored - it had actual coffee grinds in it!  After eating a piece of the toffee I was left with bitter coffee grounds stuck in my teeth for the next 30 minutes - YUCK! This was one of the worst examples of southern cooking I've had.  The only thing they did superbly was the little cornbread muffins they put on the table.  I won't be back.",N

Food and value are the two main reasons we keep coming back, but the atmosphere is pretty cool too. The place is divided into three rooms. The first room is more pedestrian with the entranceway and traffic, the second room is more romantic and the third room seems to fit larger parties and families. Though I wouldn't say this place is ideal for children, take them down the street to Thai Oscar. It's odd that those two Thai places are so close together, yet still both bring in the business. Food-wize if you're a noob try the Pad Thai or Peanut Lover's, if you're a Thai food junkie try the green curry (hot) and your head will explode. The satay appetizer is very good, we prefer beef.

24755,4UgIZOOSvfEfThte,"http://kennethtiongeats.… 2172 S Archer Ave (between Wentworth Ave & 21st St) Chicago, IL 60616 Neighborhood: Chinatown (312) 326-5040 | Menu Lao Sze Chuan is possibly one of the best Chinese restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining in in the last year. In my time eating in American restaurants, I rarely encountered offal meats - the internal organs, and discarded parts of the butchered animal. According toe Wikipedia, (http://en.wikipedia.org/…) the American South uses more offal. Rocky Mountain oysters (or bull testicles), are also a delicacy in Western US. It's much more common in Chinese cooking. Seeing ""Pig Ear Szechuan Style"" (4.75/5) (dish A02) warmed my heart. Offal bodes well for the authenticity of a Chinese restaurant (maybe non-Cantonese). Tender cartilage in spicy red oil. Wonderful crunch of harder cartilage bits. Mapo Tofu (4/5) (dish 609) was very spicy. Pairs well with rice. The only bum note for me was Chili Eggplant (2/5) (dish 633). It was an odd mix of sour and spicy, that left a persistent sour taste in my mouth after eating a slice or two. For dessert, black rice congee (4.25/5) (dish 901) has lotus seeds (those crunchy white kernels called baiguo), black rice in a cloyingly sweet soup. Recommended. In Singapore we have a very close descendant, pulot hitam - which you get when you add a lot of coconut milk. Lao Sze Chuan is a great addition to Chinese food in America. Even in New York City, I haven't had this type of Chinese food. Head there if you're in Chicago!",N

I was hoping Giordano's would've changed my mind about my feelings with the Chicago-style of pizza when I went back there this year. I definitely had no complaints with the service. They were prompt and our waitress was kind enough to offer her suggestions to us, being that we were tourists. As for the food, we ordered an order of calamari and small special (green pepper, mushroom, onion, and sausage) stuffed pizza. A slice of the pizza really showed that it was thick indeed (http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ) The crust was flaky and I felt that the pizza itself had a higher proportion of cheese to ingredients. The quantity of the pizza for the two of us was enough to last us two meals, dinner and next day's breakfast.

Since we were celebrating a promotion, we decided to go all out for dessert.  Unfortunately, I forgot the name of what we ordered but it was the most expensive dessert and HUGE.  It was cotton candy in a glass filled with caramel popcorn, cinnamon flan, chocolate cake and a ginormous plantain sundae.  Yum.",N

The food is pretty good, the decor is nothing to write home about and the location/parking for this place...meh. But the reason I love this place so much is because of the owner. He is perhaps the sweetest man I have ever met. He always welcomes you into his establishment with a smile and you can't help but be in a good mood when you leave. I support this restaurant because it is in my neighborhood and they have been going through some rough financial times (there is a great tear-jerking article about this place in Time Out Chicago). I believe supporting businesses that continually go above and beyond - these are the nicest people and the food is good, so I try and go once a week.Now for the food...the curry is flavorful - I recommend the Clay Pot Chicken and the Roasted Duck Curry. I usually get one of those two when I order, but I must admit I have only lived nearby for a few months. But try the watermelon smoothie when you go (no bubble tea). I can't eat there without getting one.Please try this place. You will not be let down. And say hey to the owner for me.",Y

30236,5yJEFIfW3gjrnp9BRWV0Sw,"Yes, a solid four stars. As evidenced by the hundreds of yelp reviews on this place, Nuevo Leon may be the most famous Mexican restaurant in Pilsen. And deservedly so, I think - good ambiance/decor, friendly crowd, very inexpensive, and solid food. This is a great place to take people from out of town and new to the city; good place as a starting/ending point for Pilsen exploration. The food! First, I warn of the guacamole. For some reason, the guacamole is weirdly bland. Couldn't tell you why - there were no less than four types of salsas on our table last night, each of a different flavor and all with enough kick to open up your sinuses a bit. But now the good stuff: I always like the enchiladas and the chilaquiles, and friends have reported favorably on the burritos and taco platters. Also, you will want a horchata. They are more than worth a dollar and really add a delightful cinnamon-vanilla lining to the whole dining experience. Possibly my favorite part of eating at Nuevo Leon is the random, complementary appetizer you are served alongside your salsa and chips - usually a sort of pork-bean-tortilla combo, though occasionally a cup of chicken-based soup. Even for a vegetarian who doesn't actually eat them, the appetizers just make the whole experience a little more interesting and unique than your typical Chicago mexican place.",N

God damn I forgot how good Chicago Diner is, yikes. Way before my Yelping days I'd tackle this spot any time I was in the city, so during a trip back to the home country I obviously had to stop by for some grub. Chocolate chip pancakes, tofu scramble, seitan sausage and country potatoes just like I remember. My lady's Egg Biscuit Sammy (made with tofu instead of egg) was stupid good. No lie, if I still lived around these parts this would be a weekly stop for life, I am slightly bummed I couldn't squeeze in one more trip as that Chickn C-Zar sandwich had my name all over it. Amazing food for sure, but also perfect service. No matter what you ask your server it's all smiles and assistance. Whether you're a vegetarian, vegan, meat eater, or alien I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy this food. Give it a shot, you're body, the animals, and the planet will thank you for it.

I always get roast pork in Cuban places, so I had to try it here.  I wish they gave plantains instead of yuca, but it was good, although a little dry.  They used vinegar in the recipe, which I didn't think was typical, at least from other Cuban places I've been too, but I may be mistaken.  Perhaps it's a nuevo Cuban touch.     The sangria was very good - not too sugary.   The wait was long, but the bar area was not crowded or too loud to have drinks and chat while waiting for the table.  I don't remember anything exceptionally positive or negative about the service.  Overall, it was only $30-$35/person including appetizers and sangria.  However, the bar charged my bf twice for the pre-dinner drinks, which he didn't find out until it showed up on his credit card bill.  Fortunately, he kept the receipt, and the restaurant kindly reversed the charge.",N

The dough has a great chewy quality despite being thin, and the toppings are about as fresh and well presented as you can get. The menu is narrow, though. I understand that true neapolitan pizzas have a pretty limited number of ways to prepare and top, but I don't see a reason to stick so close to doctrine. They've got a great crust and while they have 16 something pizzas listed, they're all basically minor variations on 3 or 4 different pizzas. I love them all, but I'd go back way more often if they had more variety. The atmosphere tries to be intimate and friendly, but it comes off more as classy pizza parlor. The wine choices are only decent, way outclassed by the pizza. The staff are friendly and helpful.",N

Well....this was my last meal in Chicago and I have to say that this was one of the most memorable of them all.   We came right when it opened and we took advantage of their lunch special, which included a 7"" one topping pan pizza and beer or coke for $5.   Five.  Dollars. I had my pizza with Sausage, Garlic, and Fresh Tomatoes.  Paid only $1 for the extra toppings.  The garlic added some nice flavor to the sauce and it was the best dollar I spent in Chicago. The sauce was great, the pizza had a great crust with a nice crisp, and the ingredients were very flavorful.  It was a great piece of pie and the best we had in Chicago.  If anyone has tried a better pizza in Chicago, then I would love to hear about it.  But this was clearly the best in our trip to the midwest.   So definitely try Gino's and Lou''s to get your own opinion, but don't be foolish by leaving this out of the discussion if you're looking to try the best pizza of Chicago.",N

Umm... shouldn't you have alerted me to this before you made all of my food?  They tried to convince me to come pick it up, even offering a discount.  This was a nice gesture, but I requested delivery because I live a half hour away via L and don't have a car... if I wanted to do carry out, I would have requested that.  I also would have figured that since it was their mistake and the food was already made, they would have just sucked it up and delivered it this time so that they could avoid covering the cost of the food, but that was not the case. The clueless guy on the phone finally agreed to refund my money, but when I didn't see the refund a week later I called the restaurant again and spoke with a manager who had no idea that this whole incident had taken place and that I was promised a refund.  She fulfilled that request shortly after we spoke, which I certainly appreciated, but the original experience and the poor response to it really left a bad taste in my mouth.",N

Anyway, on to the food.  We ordered the bone marrow, jamon serrano, milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, mussels, and wagyu beef.  The bone marrow was excellent.  I've had bone marrow at another restaurant before, but this was really good.  A bit on the oily side but it was a good smear with the salt and salad.  My husband enjoyed his jamon.  Our little toddler, who accompanied us to a fancy dinner on a Friday night, really loved her pork shoulder.  I thought it was good, although not my favorite.  She devoured it.  The wagyu beef was also tasty, although we ordered it to be cooked medium, which is a big mistake if eating wagyu.  Must get it rare so that it melts in your mouth like it's supposed to. I am currently suffering from pregnancy brain so when a server brought scallops to our table and asked if we ordered scallops, I just looked at him and said yes.  Turns out, we ordered mussels, not scallops.  Anyway, after I took pictures of my scallops and blinded our neighboring politicians, I took a bite and it was to die for!  Best scallops I've had and the sauce was amazing.  I'm not sure if it was creme fraiche or not because I didn't order it.  Whatever it was, I was ready to lick my skewer clean. We ate so much food and it was one of the best meals we ate in Chicago.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the tight squeeze at the tables.  Do you know how embarrassing it is to ask two people to scoot their chairs in even more so a pregnant mama can get through?  It's definitely getting 4.5 stars since we were not charged for our surprise dish.  We also fled the restaurant in a hurry when the table on the other side of the politicians just got an apology for their scallop order that just came out after a very long wait.",N

10955,EsZW0LECthjJXqohSUb3JA,"I don't get it. Everyone raves about Piece, but I'm a little overwhelmed by the giant rectangle of relatively cheeseless, thin-crusted, wet pizza. Its heavy on the sauce and brick oven flavor, moderate on the toppings, and skimpy on the cheese. Its not a bad pizza, its just not on my favorite list. We ordered two medium red pizzas; one with chicken and broccoli, and one with mushrooms, tomatoes, and green peppers. I have been here before about a year ago and had pizzas with some of the meat toppings and mashed potatoes. Similarly, I had stared at my friends confused at their raving about the starchy sloppy masterpiece that they had created. I would appreciate the ""build-your-own pizza"" menu if Piece added a few more options and didn't charge so much for a rather skimpy portion of each topping. However, I imagine that any more than two toppings would cause the pizza to fall apart like the generic paper towel in the Bounty commercial. Popular toppings missing are pineapple, canadian bacon, green olives, and sun-dried tomatoes. Since I'm a fan of pizzas called ""the works"" or ""veggie lover's,"" paying for each vegetable topping get a little pricey. Still, its a relatively cheap group outing. The atmosphere is typically hipster and the space is rather dark and cavernous. The wait can get pretty long, but they are more than accommodating with reservations. There is an echo from the barn-like ceiling, so just get used to nodding your head rather than hearing every word that the rest of your party is saying. All in all, I will go here again because someone else made the reservation. I will keep my mouth shut because nothing is really wrong with the pizza, but I will vehemently oppose adding mashed potatoes. Am I just a thin-crust hater?

Ordered the Bloody Mary with a beer chaser. It was definitely a great choice as most of the items are quite pricey, and if you're like me, you probably drank heavily the night before and can appreciate and electrolyte/potassium boost from the Bloody Mary. The beer was just refreshing and added a nice little buzz to my punch. My friend ordered the Prophecy which was a mixture of Italian vermouth, bitters and an egg. It was a bit like eggnog that punched you right in the face. I ended up having to finish it for her. Think: frothy whiskey-like substance you don't know whether you'd love to hate it, or you'd want to make sweet love to it. The pork rinds were great. Fresh and crispy. The bacon is a dream. Think thick sliced pork fat back that is braised. My only issue is that at those prices, you'd be better off going Lord of the Flies style and hunting down your own pig.

(Sorry Pizza Hut, I found out you don't count) Totally a recommend from a friend who lived out in the area who is a pizza fanatic (the guy eats pizza about 4 times a week and remains under 400 pounds, so I had to take his word for it) The place is cute and the local beer we tried gave us a decent buzz before we started to chow down. We got a standard deep dish, pepperoni with the caramelized crust. The caramelized crust was KEY! so crunchy along the ridge with a great flavor. With this being my first deep dish I wasn't prepared for the amount of food I was expected to consume, but according to my BF who grew up in Indiana this deep dish wasn't as thick as the standard (that terrifies me) In all I loved it but I wasn't impressed enough to say it was the best (plus it was my first deep dish, so come on!)

It tasted like it had been frozen, thawed, and frozen again.   Maybe I got a freak steak; maybe not.  In either case, I'm never going back.",N

Found out about this fantastic hot dog place through Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, so I marked Hot Doug's down on my must try list during the trip to Chicago last month. After getting to the place, we had to wait like 45 mins on a windy, freezing cold day. Once I had a bite of the hot dog, though, I completely forgot about the cold that I just endured. No Reservations? No complaints! Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel - To die for. There were four round slices of Foie Gras pate, creamy, silk and rich. Melted in my mouth. I regretted not ordering two after finishing my Foie Gras hot dog. Three-Chili Wild Boar Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mayonnaise, Raw Milk-Cheddar Cheese Spread and Crispy Fried Onions - Surprisingly delicious, with just a little kick to it. Crispy fried onions were thinly sliced on top, crispy and crunchy, along with the mild-cheddar cheese, it was a great combination. Antelope Sausage with Roasted Red Pepper-Roasted Garlic Mayonnaise and Hickory-Smoked Sweet Swiss Cheese - The red pepper was cooked perfectly, neither raw nor too soft, and it meshed well with the Garlic Mayonnaise. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I wanted to try out all of their specialty sausages if I could.

Speaking of the Salad bar, this was a big disappointment to me. I had heard that the salad bar was amazing, but I thought it was okay. There is definitely a wide range of things: raw oysters, maki sushi, pasta salads, veggies, and other salad type things. The dessert was okay, but again I wasn't impressed.

For $5.25, you get a cute packaged box with a Superdawg (pure beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun topped with mustard, onions and peppers) and Superfries. At least that's what the menu tells you. What it tasted like was a Ballpark frank with some reheated frozen crinkle cut fries.

The highlight of our dinner was the Ravioli.  It melted in your mouth! To be honest with you each coarse had  a wine pairing so between the wonderful company and wine I forgot what the meat coarse was.  Ha! Whatever it was, I absolutely loved it! Dare I say it...it reminded me of the meat served on the Big Mac coarse at Next!  I was perfectly tender and flavorful. That alone will make me come back, considering I will never experience Next's Big Mac again! When we eat at places we always consider if we would bring out of town guests here.  This is definitely a place we would bring out of town guests.  If they're lucky (or unlucky) they'll get a trip to the lovely smokey dive bar that is Richards.

51082,e6QlTlnU-aOcC8a9S81n9w,"I've been making bi-annual trips to Grand Lux Cafe, usually when I'm in the mood for a nice dinner at a price that is affordable with food that makes me feel as if I've outdone myself. For everything that Grand Lux encompasses, I really should hate it: tourists who venture for a day in the city from destinations as far away as Wilmette and Glenview, the popularity of the place just because it's owned by the Cheesecake Factory, and every single parent who took their daughter to the American Girl Store treating their child to a late lunch. I don't hate the Grand Lux, because the food and service make you forget all of this stuff. The waiters are not too frou-frou, acting as if they're serving in a restaurant 3x as expensive, they know what they serve and that's that. The food-- from salad to dessert-- is immaculate. My favorite appetizer salad is the house salad, because it's so simple yet just enough before the main course (and how many restaurants can you really call a house salad your favorite?) Recently, I had the Chicken Royale, which was perfectly cooked, perfectly breaded, and served with what I thought were the best damn mashed potatoes. The green beans were also unforgettable, and these are green beans we're talking about. Also, for $26 you can get an excellent merlot, which complemented everything perfect. I doubt it was just a day of good choices from the menu; it doesn't take a lot of money to have a good dinner, although it does take a lot to impress me with a restaurant. For all the bad things that Grand Lux attracts, it serves everything else just right, and not overdone. My one complaint-- and it's a small one-- is that if you do not get a booth, you will most likely be stuck sitting inches away from that wonderful couple from Wilmette treating their kid to a post-American Girl dinner; I certainly  appreciate the intimacy of French cafe seating, but we're in Chicago (god love this city) and this is not the type of environment where you want to be seated inches away from someone. Still, I suggest you go, and make sure you're able to carry around a doggy bag afterwards; you will need it.",N

Whole Fish of the Day:  Woodfire Seabass with Sea Salt Crust.  This was flaky and uber fresh; however my only complaint would be that when they filet the fish in front of you, they toss the crunchy bits and skin which to me, is one of the tastiest parts of fish, especially when woodfired and crusted. Porchetta Alla Romana-Roasted Pork-Mmm, perfectly moist inside and crunchy and thick on the outside. Dessert: Chocolate Cake filled with real cocoa gooeyness, topped with Cinnamon Ice Cream.  Yum.

We went on a Saturday night and got there a little before 9:00pm. Our intention was to get a table, order some pizza and watch the karaoke. That's not exactly what happened. When we got there, the place was filled to the brim with people so it was hard to even walk in. I approached the man at the door to put our name down for a table. He was pretty direct when he said ""that's not going to happen."" At least we knew where we stood, but I thought the delivery could use a bit of tweaking. So we stood around and watched as all the pizzas came out of the kitchen. They looked and smelled amazing. We gathered around the bar, hoping to slide into a sliver of a spot to order but we were told they couldn't serve us food unless we were seated somewhere. So instead we all ordered a round of the in house brewed beer. Each of the four of us had a different one, but I tasted them all and they were absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back now that I know the drill - get there early to order, but I believe it will be worth it since the food looked incredible.

33393,b79mcRxgROQG7FMV2kO1sA,"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to hit up Sunda forever! We are huge sushi buffs and heard this place was extremely unique and interesting. Our server recommended the Peared Sake to drink. I like sake but I wasn't sure how this would taste. I ordered it and man was it good, I could have had five or six. Made with Grey Goose La Poire, Zipang Sparking Sake, pineapple juice, ginger syrup, and a cinnamon rim it was a fantastic mix of flavors. At $13 it was a little expensive but hey, it was my first time here. My boyfriend stuck with a good glass of Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc. We started with Rock Shrimp Tempura made with glazed walnuts and glazed honey aioli. We love the rock shrimp at FIsh Bar and this did not disappoint. The serving was quite large and I was pleasantly surprised with the result. The star of the evening? The Lobster Wagyu Roll. Outstanding doesn't even come close to describing how amazing this roll is! I have never tasted anything like it and probably never will again! I've had Wagyu beaf at Roka Akor but when paired with lobster it was like nothing I have ever tasted. The scallions, jalapeño, wagyu sashimi, creamy lobster, and truffle-foire aioli was the perfect combination of excellence. We also tried the Escolar which was under the category ""Topped Nigiri Sunda Style"". The Great White Tuna came with truffle shavings, a potato chip, and chives. Was it good? Yes. $9 for two pieces? Unacceptable. Macku does better topped nigiri for less and for bigger pieces at that with more creative toppings. I wasn't impressed with The Number Ten roll. It was a tempura roll with shrimp roe, avocado, scallions, cream cheese, unagi sauce, and wasabi aioli. I just wasn't too impressed overall but my boyfriend loved it and I trust his judgement. We also had some signature sticky rice with beef on top. I'm not sure the exact name but the server made sure to point them out. The rice comes with other types of meat and fish on top as well. Generally, try what the server recommends but be prepared to pay. Nothing is cheap here but it's worth a shot. Dessert was also great. We had a wonderful dessert martini made with Effen vodka that our server so kindly split for us without our asking. For dessert we had vanilla bean ice-cream basked into a slice of carrot cake. Absolutely outstanding! Four stars for some amazing signature dishes and drinks. The service was great and attentive and I appreciated the speed at which the dishes were paced.

51945,tK4oKKZ0Lz5OAo3yF-cy2w,"My friends and I were going to see a show at Empty Bottle.  We got there a little early and parked in front of Lockdown.  I peeked in side and thought it looked super cool, so I convinced my friends to check it out with me... there is nothing I love more than checking out new joints which can satiate my gluttonous needs for munchies and drinks! We walked in around 9:30pm and snagged the last three seats and the bar (the place fills up quickly!).  It was a Thursday and they were offering half price draft brews.  They even allow you to taste the different options before selecting one.  I am not a beer drinker but my friends really liked what they had to offer. After perusing the menu, I noticed they have a huge selection of burgers and mac and cheese here.  I have a new fall obsession with mac and cheese so I really wanted to try it.  I asked how long it typically takes since we were going to catch a show and they said they could have it out in 10 minutes max.  Since I was not really hungry but was craving mac and cheese I ordered the side portion which came with bacon and green onion.  It was out in less than 10 minutes.  The side portion was a meal on its own... the best mac and cheese I have had out! I really liked the decor of Lockdown.  The service was quick and friendly.  The only thing I wish they would change is to give out individual tabs.  Since we were sitting at the bar I thought we would all get a tab, but they gave us just one check.",N

The lady who picked up the phone at Sun Wah had an accent and obviously was having some trouble describing the various ducks they offered so I decided to do her a favor and speak Chinese. I speak rather well but can't write it so as she spoke in Chinese I began writing as fast as I could in English. It's rather difficult translating Chinese spoken words into English words. Anyway, I asked her to repeat herself and she got rather abrupt telling me that she had told me X number of times what they offered and then hung up on me! I called back and this time a man answered. I asked him the same question and as he started to answer, he began to laugh and then he hung up on me as well! Believe that? I guess they don't care to offer good customer service now that business is good. Keep up the good work Sun Wah!!! I decided to call Hon Kee, right down the street on Argyle.

Walking up to the bakery, I can say that if it wasn't for the reviews on yelp, I would have walked away. The place looks like it needs a makeover and some better lighting. The cakes in the display window look like they've been sitting there since the early 90's and need desperately to be modernized. I was happy to see that they had red velvet cupcakes (my favorite), and also got one each of the carrot and mocha cupcakes. Overall, the cupcakes had good flavor but are a little on the dry side. Flavor and taste wise they reminded me a lot of Sprinkles in LA. Not a bad dessert option if you're in the area.",N

What I had to talk about was the service.  First off, this was a week-end night, although still relatively early.  The hostess (Ebony) seats us at a quiet table for 2 (loved it)  2 seconds later the loudest man in the world is seated at the table next to us.  I am not going to scream to my husband for the entire dinner.  I asked Ebony if we could be reseated elsewhere, even though I loved the first table.  Two other hostesses, Liz and Genny, along with Ebony find us an even better table, and then wish me a happy birthday!  I'm thinking this is never getting any better.  Then, Andy, our waiter, shows up and just rocks it out.

The group I weekend brunch it up with, we always order one of the specials for the whole table to share, along with our own special entrees. We love the veggie/egg combos, but the pancakes and french toasts - that are sweet and have bold interesting flavors are always top of our list to share and love (but we couldn't handle a whole meal of it)!

The menu was OK. I didn't think there was much to chose from, and my vegetarian friend almost had a heart attack.  She ordered the curry, lemongrass, butternut squash soup- with a marshmallow.  I think the marshmallow was her favorite part of the soup.   The popcorn in place of the bread, was probably my favorite part of the whole meal.  It was covered in delicious-ness and I couldn't stop asking for more baskets. That was great. I ordered the Fig salad, which was good.  I was expecting something a little more substantial for $15, but hey...I sucked it up and ordered the Oysters for my main entree.  The oysters were EH- nothing special, and one almost made me gag in the restaurant.  There were 5 different types, and only 2 out of the 5 were even remotely edible.  Oh well.  An expensive bust, I would say, but we got to experience fine dining in Chicago...even though the rest of us came from places with equally ""fine"" dining.",N

I wasn't a fan of the taste but maybe I'm being to picky because everything else I ate (cornbread, ribs, mac and cheese, BBQ wings, hush puppies, BBQ chips and pickles) were great.

I chose the milk and cookies (glass of milk with 3 different cookies) Again fantastic, the cookies were soft and huge. I think the oatmeal-bacon cookie is my favorite, the other two - almond cookie bar and double chocolate were awesome too.

I'll start off by saying the beer list was very impressive and I was glad to see they offered the Belgium Duvel ale, which was one of the first Belgium micros brought to the States.  Our server was very knowledgable about the whole beer menu (and food menu, but that's later) and was able to suggest exactly what each of us were looking for!  I had the Brasserie Dupont' Saison and the Hercule Stout.  Both of which I highly recommend.  If you are looking to expand your beer conquest, you will be thoroughly satisfied at this restaurant. The small dish-sharing style of restuarants is catching on quite quickly and this is of no exception.  That being said, it's always kind of hard to guess how much to order and which dishes may be too similar to each other.  We were a group of 4 to put it in perspective. Once again to our rescue, our server nailed the perfect amount of food and which dishes we shouldn't duplicate. We ordered a half of farm chicken, the potee, the veal loin, and the squash and romanesco veggie plates.  The farm chicken was cooked to an amazing tenderness and the veal loin was very good as well.  We also ordered the chef's selection of oysters and these were delicious.  I'm a decent fan of oysters and these were the best I've had in a long time, especially for Chicago.  We did get two desserts; the waffles and apple pie.  If you were to pick just one, I'd go with the waffles. Not a typical dessert menu item, but done very well. I think the value and price are great.  For 4 people to each have two drinks, be sufficiently full from a variety of oustanding dishes AND desserts, and have a high quality waitress for about $60 per person after tip is nearly unbelievable!

This is a great place on a cold winter Monday and a beer lover's palace - which probably explains the high male to female ratio. But that's just fine with me. The crowd was laid back and the music low and jazzy (at least tonight).  We didn't have to wait for a table for dinner - which is rare at Hopleaf. The food and drink are the stars here -- oh, and one certain staff member resembling Clark Gable who was SUPER entertaining and accommodating! You know who you are. It must be said that all the staff seem to know their stuff and the service was great. You have to go to the bar and order your food/drinks if you are sitting in the front but it comes out promptly. I SURE did have a few Belgians here. This is no place to order a Bud Light. Hopleaf =  BEER! The selection will dazzle you. If you're a novice there are good descriptions on the menu but the bartenders will steer you the right direction too. My favorite tonight was the Delirum Tremens. Pink Elephants on the goblet.. heh.. heh.. This beer has a high alcohol content (if you can't tell from the name). We started with 2 orders of mussels. They offer traditional Belgian style and a special of the night. We had the Belgian and the special which was a lobster and white wine broth.. I like!! I have been hesitant about ordering mussels since reading Anthony Bourdain's ""Kitchen Confidential"" so this is the only place I will still order them. They are excellent. They are served with perfect pomme frites and mayo. The broth is divine nectar and resting on top of each order is crusty bread for soaking it up. After reading all the previous reviews I had to try the C B & J, served on sourdough w/ cashew butter, fig jam and morbier cheese. It's a fancy grilled cheese basically and it's obvious it could be a great sandwich but  tonight mine was a bit too greasy and seemed like it sat too long before serving - the cheese was hard to find as if it got too hot and oozed out of the sandwich or into the bread. Why has nobody thought of this combo before? It makes so much sense. I confess I have put peanut butter on grilled cheese b4. Is that weird?? The stilton mac & cheese that comes with it... OH. My, God. YES! But wowee this is a rich, filling plate of food & they don't skimp on portions. Good thing I worked out today and didn't eat much till dinner!! One of my companions had the red cabbage salad. It was really flavorful, crunchy and surprisingly tasty - with bits of apple, goat cheese and pistachio. I liked it much more than I thought I would.

I didn't know what to expect because I had such a difficult time getting reservations and dealt with a cold, bordering on rude hostess, but as soon as my friends and I were seated, all ill-feelings were forgiven.  We were mesmerized by the bright colors and hues splashed across ceilings and the walls which held what seemed like hundreds of bottles of wine.  The mood is bright and prepares you for an enjoyable meal.  The menu is very simple, drawing from various South American influences, and perfect for a crowd with different tastes.  Among the appetizers tried, the winners include the empanada (which is an overgrown version of any you would find in South America) and the guacamole.  The chicken dishes and the arranchera steak were also crowd pleasers.  Surprisingly, not only were the dishes very tasty, but the portions were quite generous too.  I wasn't particularly a fan of the ceviche.  The fish wasn't of the freshest, right off the boat quality, but when you're paying these kinds of prices, there's not much room for complaining. While most trendy restaurants fail to post their prices on the web, Carnivale is very upfront with what you're getting.  http://www.carnivalechic… With drinks, appetizer, and entree, you can go from $25-$40/person.   Carnivale definitely reigns supreme amongst the other Kleiner restaurants.",N

34782,jYW0gHkufxhF15kZX9K15A,"I really don't get the hype on this place. Maybe I had too high expectations after hearing people raving about this place. The food was between good and ok, but it wasn't great. My fiance and I were not blown away. We've definitely had better contemporary sushi that have blown us away and leaving us impressed and wanting more (we are self-professed foodies and we eat out ALOT). The Spicy Tail of Two Tunas specialty roll was odd mainly because it was topped with fried shallots. The combination did not go well. Contemporary sushi is supposed to look pretty. The roll was like Plain Jane and the random sprinkles of fried shallots over the pieces and plate made the entire thing look ugly! I love fried shallots, but with the roll? It was odd. The other roll we ordered was Wa-Machi which was basically filled with hamachi and topped with green tobiko. The look of the roll was also not very appetizing because of its dull appearance. Don't get me wrong, I love traditional rolls anytime but if I'm going to pay $15 for a darn contemporary roll, it better look like there was some effort in making it look pretty and contemporary! Our favorite dish of the night was the string beans with lap cheong (Chinese sausage) and walnuts. This, I have to admit, was very delicious. Our server was adequate although I couldn't help but notice that another server who was serving the other tables next to us was beyond adequate than our server. After each dish arrived at the nearby tables, their server would go over and explain to them what went into the dish and how it was cooked. To me, this demonstrates professionalism and knowledge by the server which I regret that our server did not quite display at a restaurant like Sunda. The prices are also a little higher than other contemporary Asian places I've been to. I'm not a fan of how their sashimi menu worked. This is the only restaurant I've been to where each order of sashimi comes with 4 pieces and because of that, each order already costs about $14-$16. That defeats the whole purpose of ordering a large variety of sashimi platter to try and sample. At other places I've been to, one order of sashimi would come with 2 pieces. This is perfect for ordering a wide array of sashimi with a couple slices for each type of fish to try and savor. Sunda is a good place if you just want to go out and dine in a modern Asian restaurant. But if you're looking for better food, there are many other places in the city that can offer that.",N

I'm pretty sure Doug actually took my order, he was super friendly and it seems he treats all his customers like he knows them - very inviting atmosphere. I ordered the The Paul Kelly with fries and a small drink. I was surprised that you were allowed to grab your own cup, and get free refills. I waited around five minutes and got my food (I went at 3pm). It was amazing. Who would have thought that a bratwurst and fries might be one of the best meals I've ever eaten.

Recommend the saketinis, shishito peppers, rock shrimp tempura, beef lollipops, Asian grill NY strip steak, brussel sprout salad. Sushi - if you are knowledgable about sushi, the combinations here can be irritatingly, overly elaborate, especially when the server pushes them on you. ""Creamy lobster"" just sounds gross. Wish they had simpler, classic rolls with less unorthodox stuff in them for sharing. Service is attentive but beware the upsell! The servers are trained to suggest more expensive/elaborate items and give the same shpiel to everyone. Just stick to your guns.

I have been to Wakamono at least 30 times and have taken most of my friends there--everyone raves about it and they often return for more. Their drinks are well worth the cost and the service is efficient and courteous. The only reason why I am rating them at 4 starts, rather than 5 is because we have difficulty understanding the staff at times.

I settled on the traditional Cuban sandwich and my friend got the veggie platter. The sandwich was pretty good, not too greasy and full of pork. My only complaint was that overall, it was a little bland. There definitely could have been more pickles/mustard to give it a little kick. I ended up dipping it into the house-made hot sauce, which was really a really nice and smoky sauce. For about $8, I was stuffed and happy.

I usually make my annual pilgrimage here once a year (I live over an hour away, and it's really hard to rationalize traveling that far for a hot dog, so I wait til I find an excuse to be in the area), usually in Jan or Feb and at 2 or 3 in the afternoon. Still, despite my careful planning, there is ALWAYS a line. Which I don't actually mind. It gives me time to change my mind on what I had planned on getting, and then go back to my original idea. Several times. I always go for something that's on the specials list which are good, but this time I branched out and went for The Game of the Week, which was fantastic. Since they change all the time, it's not really worth mentioning in detail what it was, but if I'm ever faced with the opportunity to have an elk sausage again, I definitely will take advantage of that opportunity. I think the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the buns are a little on the forgettable side. Don't get me wrong, the dogs themselves are great, the topping combos are interesting and delicious, but if you're going to put all sorts of great stuff on a great dog, shouldn't the bun be great as well?",N

It's all small plates to share so perfect to come with a smallish group (3-4) or not one plate will be too small.  Everything came out randomly but paced well.

Pretty okay - fried brussel sprouts:  oversalted but good - bone marrow:  no jam to go with and the bread was too oily so putting oil (marrow) on oil bread put me off a bit;  serving is generous with 3 bones Overall a great meal at a great price point.  The wines are all international and seems like they are willing to open them and sell as quartinos if desired.  Will return again!",N

It was pretty crowded up front - and I'm not sure I would love the table in the front window for that reason - but we eventually grabbed seats at the bar and from then on the wait flew. While we waited, we tried a couple of very reasonably priced bottles of wine and they even brought out some complimentary pizza from the kitchen for us to munch on, which was quite good! Once seated the experience was great - our server was helpful but not intrusive or pretentious. We tried the polenta and ragu of the day (which was pork), the bruschette (which has a tuna and white bean topping), crispy pork belly, calamari, olives and the burrata to share to start. All were very good but the polenta and ragu stood head and shoulders above the rest. It was awesome! I've been thinking about it for days. Our main courses (I shared the giant rigatoni and the strip steak with someone) were just ok. For desert I would definitely recommend the chocolate hazelnut mousse - it was chocolate heaven. Overall I would definitely recommend this place for a fun dinner with friends - just be prepared to wait a bit for a table. The wine menu is incredibly affordable (I heard they sell all the bottles of wine at retail + $7) and the tapas style portions are great for sharing and trying a lot of different dishes.

We started out with empanadas.  Those delicious little pockets of fried dough were SO good.  The goat cheese was my favorite.  I had a pork dish that wasn't great.  How can a fried dish be dry??  And my dining companion had a thin steak, which I ate several bites of.  He also generously shared his plantains with me.  So good. We wrapped up dinner with a little bite of dessert that our server recommended, the snickers empanada.  Hot, melty snickers wrapped in fried dough---wow!  So obviously this was not the healthiest of meals, however, it's okay to be naughty every once in a while, right?",N

One of the owners even came over to check on us and ask our opinion about the place. I ordered the Tallgrass Beef Burger. It was large, juicy, perfectly cooked, and tasty. The ""a' plenty"" that it came with was great as well. In fact, I enjoyed the food so much I went back two days later for dinner and was again floored with how great the service and the food were. If you are there for dinner and enjoy spicy food, you HAVE to try the Jalapeno Gator Sausage. I'll leave it at that. Now quit reading my review and go eat already!",N

We had the sampler special for dessert which included a tempura banana with chocolate sauce which was delicious. Coast lived up to its lofty expectations and was very fairly priced compared to other area sushi restaurants.",N
19112,LOxvrRjFTpJQRS6gQmDUDw,"Went to this India House since I had a groupon just sitting around and going to expire in a month so we made use it this past weekend. We didn't have reservations and we got there at 8 pm, but they were able to seat us within 5 minutes even though they said it would be about 20 minutes. The servers were good, but one of them had such a thick accent it was even hard for me to understand what the heck he was saying. This is the first time I have came to the downtown location because I always go to the Schaumburg location and would rather come back to this location, but the only thing that holds me back is the prices. The food is not worth the price. I think I would rather go to Hema's Kitchen. Don't get me wrong, the food and service was great, but the prices are high for the portions! We spent about $80 for the four of us which was about $20 for each of us, but that was with no drinks, no desserts, and no appetizer. I think that's a bit much. We ordered 3 and a half entrees as follows: mutter paneer (paneer with green peas), baingan bharta (mashed up eggplant), paneer makhani (paneer in tomato sauce) and half entree of a chicken dish which I can't remember the name to since I didn't try it (of course). We also ordered 2 baskets of regular naan which was really good (better than most places I have had it at). I tried the paneer makhani and the baingan bharta and liked them both. I thought they would be a little bit spicier and would have liked it better, but that was fine. I ordered the mutter paneer to go for my brother since he wanted it. The 3 entrees were more than enough for the four of us and we had left overs (which I was surprised about since the boys tend to eat a lot). The waiters were good and they filled our waters when needed, returned to check in on us when needed, and got us what ever we needed. Using the groupon was easy as pie. Overall I thought the place was good, but prices were high. I would come back, but it would have to be with another groupon. So technically, we paid $60 total when you don't count the $20 free from groupon. That just makes it a whole lot better and worthy of coming back. Decor is nothing special, but it was pretty busy, but then again it was a Saturday (and I'm sure others had groupons as well).",N

17089,k213PPM95WrWKo-HPmMiYA,"I've lived in Andersonville for over a year now and have heard so many people heaping praise on Calo that I decided it was finally time to check it out. Went on a Saturday night and made the mistake of not making a reservation, so we waited an hour. The bar was packed, so I just got a drink and we hovered wherever we could find room. It was a little claustrophobic, but I guess that's to be expected. To start, the bread was freaking fantastic. I'm not one to rave about a bread basket, but this was probably one of the best bread baskets I have ever encountered. Warm, fluffy focaccia bread, deliciously seasoned white crusty bread, and a huge mountain of salty whipped butter. Yum. That was worth the wait alone. We got the mussels as an appetizer, which were to die for. I've just started eating mussels, but they were amazing by even general food standards, and my boyfriend (the mussel expert) loved them. Huge amounts of meat with tons of garlic and wine cream sauce. I got some sort of chicken piccata-like item that was on special. Chicken piccata is probably one of my favorite Italian dishes, and this was a good one. The chicken was thicker than most piccata dishes have it, but it was soft and juicy and my knife ran through it like butter. Boyfriend had the gnocchi with asiago and goat cheese, which he said was great. One other reason I liked this place: the service was impeccable. The hostesses were friendly despite the overwhelming crowds, our server was always there for anything we needed and made sure to check in with us any time he passed by, and water was refilled quickly. This was really great to see in a crowded restaurant in Chicago on a Saturday night, where poor service is so common anymore. It was a little pricey, but for the portion sizes and quality of the food, I think it's just about worth it. I'm so glad I finally tried this place.",N
18213,CJ,"My fiance and I had dinner here with another couple last weekend and it was okay... it was fun to try it but I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon. Ambiance was fun , vibrant, loud. The walls are covered in bright colors that makes it feel very warm. We didn't have to wait very long for our table since we had a reservation. Now the important part - the food. We started with guacomole, braised short ribs, and ceviche as starters. The guacomole was simple and had a very strong lime flavor to it. I enjoyed it because I love lime but people at the table did not enjoy it too much so beware if you're not a lime fan. Braised short ribs were sweet and melted in your mouth (as they should). We had fish ceviche and it was okay... it's what I would expect from ceviche. Entrees - my fiance had the beef tenderloin with goat cheese puree as it came highly recommended from the waiter. It was cooked perfectly (rare) but the flavors were not a fun party in my mouth. I was not a big fan of the spicy beet salsa or the arugula chimichurri. The flavors were overpowering for me. I had the wood grilled porkchop which was pretty good.. but not a fan of the bacon-plantain fufu. But thats okay, it saved me calories (because I totally was watching my calorie count with the 5,000 calories I ate that evening)! Dessert - both couples ordered their special sorbet for the night. It came in a trio of plum, peach, and raspberry. Raspberry was our fave by far. The other 2 were okay but the raspberry was the most refreshing. On a side note, we had to tune our waiter out because he reminded us of a used car salesman. He tried to push us to order everything... there was only 4 of us, not 14! And on top of that, he had no clue what he was talking about. He recommended the salmon and claimed that it was specific type of salmon (i dont remember which one) but that got my fiance VERY excited because he's had it once when it was in season in Seattle. He asked, ""Wow, how did you guys get those? Aren't they only in season in the spring? Where did you get them from?"" and the waiter looked a little taken back and said, ""Oh. It might not be that one, I can be wrong. We have a different fish of the day so I may be incorrect."" Uhm, don't they tell you what the fish of the day is specifically? I don't think it's that difficult.... I think it's fun to try once but I don't see myself as a regular  here.",N

What an awesome meal I got.  I ordered some hummus for the week, plus the chicken shawerma, and having just finished it, I am so happy I did.  I have plenty left over for dinner tomorrow, and it was amazing!

This past weekend though, we made the effort, and it was well worth it.  The Pasta Bowl is famous, at least to me, for their Rosemary Gorgonzola sauce.  If I had to pick only one sauce with which to cover pasta with for the remainder of my days, this one would be it.  It's a stinky-cheese lover's dream.  I also like the fact that they let you switch it out with the sauces that traditionally accompany certain dishes.  Pasta Bowl gets the fact that more than one sauce might be good over certain things.  No egomaniac chef forcing something upon you. The joint seems to always be jumping with Lincoln Park's young and beautiful.  It hearkened me back to my own days of yore when drinking in bars was part of a normal social life, not a temporary escape where one constantly is calculating just how drunk they can get and still be able to be a good parent the next morning.",N

The tortas are delicious. The Ahogado is AMAZING, and one of those dishes that makes me think about sandwiches differently.  The panini aren't as impressive; I had their prosciutto panini with a fried egg, and while tasty, it was a complete mess, partially because they didn't cut all the way through the bread, and flipped it upside down, so the sandwich collapsed into the basket as soon as I lifted it up.  For $13, the least they can do is cut all the way through.

53468,tfhMywaX8fsqIB0ny32TkA,"Realized I never did a review even though I came here about a year ago. I think I'm due back for round 2! Took my BF for his birthday last April and it was phenomenal! We ordered Belgian micro-brews, which were both wonderful. I hate to admit we didn't experience more of their fabulous selection, but we had just come from a Goose Island beer & cheese tasting sipping faves like Juliet (which was on the Publican's beer menu for ~$30 a glass!). The beer menu is EXTENSIVE!  If you know a beer guru, bring him/her with you! Started with a dozen oysters...I was in heaven. An oyster is not just an oyster. The Publican has an outstanding selection, each with its own size, texture and flavor. They are accompanied with a malt vinegar. Loved the pairing! Next was the potted pork rillettes with country toast. OMG. This was one of faves of the night!! Pig heaven! For the final course, we shared the family style pork platter, which came with pork tenderloin and pork sausages with sides of root vegetables. So delicious!!!! I know the menu is ever changing and I'm very curious to see what they are serving now. Plus I need to order the infamous pork rinds next time I go! BONUS: The setting is really impressive and the ""beer relics"" in the restroom area are such a great touch. Vintage goblets, etc. Very very cool. I'm also in love with the Pig Art.",N
66051,-1GkfvA3SZzjcz64ciJP5A,I like this place a lot.  My buddy lives near by there so its a great place to get a bite to eat before you go out.  Try their ultimate grilled cheese sandwich (with tomato and bacon YUM!).,Y
42684,pln3gO7tYDfG47zgLOZ7Hg,"This Italian family place screams 1975 for its decor, the large smoking section/bar, and the delicious artery-clogging food.  I haven't yet had their food delivered - it's too much fun to eat here!  The staff extremely friendly.  The food is cheap, plentiful, and delicious.  I'm not only referring to the pizza, but also many of the entrees, all of which come with the old school salad bar, replete with diverse throwback choices like artichoke hearts, canned peaches and chocolate pudding.     The bartender is always generous.  When I asked for a taste of one of the wines by the glass, he gave me a small glass entirely full.  I ordered a glass of it, and it came in something that resembled a vat, also full.  I've never left without my pants buttons groaning.",N
6541,Q9DhFMF6p,"Yeah, this place really needs to be addressed because of the never ending orgy of blindly positive reviews for Davanti on Yelp.  As I write this, another 5-star review has posted. Perplexing. Let's start with the positives.  The space is unique - the interior is worn wooden planks and really looks like a wine cellar.  The service was good - we were there on a friday night and everything still came out very promptly.  Our server was polite, helpful and the general staff was professional (I waited tables for 7 years in fine dining so I'm not just saying that). All things considered, for a special occasion, it's also not that expensive.  The girl and I had a martini each, a bottle of champagne, a bottle of red wine, and about 12 dishes, and everything came out to $175 + tip. That said, assuming you want Italian and a place that is on the nicer side of casual, $175 is way better spent somewhere else (Spacca Napoli immediately comes to mind).  Let's move now to the negatives. Find me something on this menu that I couldn't cook at home better than they did it, and I'll take this review down.  Honestly.  Let me break it down by the dishes we had - Started with a meat and cheese plate.  The slices were skimpy, and it was served with no bread.  Why?  I can appreciate that if the meat is so quality that bread actually detracts from it.  This was not the case.   It was served with fruit biscotti.  Fuck fruit biscotti.  That's the Italian equivalent of fruitcake, and fuck fruitcake. Let's see, don't get the farro salad unless you like cardboard.  Don't get the mascarpone polenta & ragu unless you like flavorless baby food.  Polenta I understand being flavorless - it never had a chance.  Beef ragu, however, should not be.  Moreover, the meat should not be tough.  Here's a tip - slow cook the ragu on low so that it retains its flavor and tenderness.  If I know that, how do you not? The rigatoni, truffle egg toast, and anchovies weren't bad, they were just unimpressive (and the rigatoni undercooked, even for al dente).  The chicken liver pate was solid, but shit, it's pate.  In the same vein, the crispy bork belly was good, but shit, it's bacon.  It wasn't even as good as bacon should should have been. This brings us, unpleasantly, to the lowpoint of the evening.  The swordfish.  Why, dear god why, would you take an amazing piece of swordfish, and then bread it?  And if you are going to do that (I'm well aware that breading fish is classic Italian cooking - that doesn't mean it isn't gross), do it with some garbage fish, like catfish or (very Italian) flounder, and serve it HOT.  Not room temperature, HOT.  The damn thing about fried food, it's only good when it's hot.  Breaded swordfish is gross, but moreover, I'm confused about why you took that extra step to make something (that was once good) terrible.  Congrats, you worked extra hard to fail. Last, but certainly not least.  Part of the buzz on this place is that their wines are retail prices.  It says it on the menu, it says it on the reviews, and your server will make the same claim.  Bullshit.  The last time I bought a bottle of Veuve Clicquot it was $45 at Binny's (gotta love Binny's).  At Davanti, $88 + a $7 in-house corkage fee (really, you're going to charge me a corkage fee for wine I just bought from you?) gets you 1 bottle of Veuve.  The Aia Vecchia Lagone (great inexpensive Italian wine by the way) is $17 retail.  It's not $30 + your absurd corkage fee. You explain to me how a 200% markup is retail pricing, and I'll buy you a bottle of $95 Veuve Clicquot and spoon feed you their shitty food. Oh, my sidecar was excellent.  Nice job bartender.",N
44849,zbhyN,"Ok so yes, I went back AGAIN.  Even with its new found popularity, thanks to Check Please!, word of mouth and probably Yelp (ah-hem, someone's ROtD!)  I am happy to report that Bonsoiree still delivers amazing cuisine and a wonderful dining experience.  They just introduced an end-of-winter menu that offers brand new flavors in their standard five, seven or thirteen course menus.  This includes rabbit and gnocchi ""shooters"", spicy scallops on the half shell, house-cured bacon (with homemade marshmallows!) and more.   It is apparent that the great press has not gone to their heads.  The boys in the kitchen were just as humble as ever; still passionate and excited to share their creations with us.  Executive Chef/owner Shin Thompson was running the entire front of the house, down to folding napkins for people when they get up-no job it too small- I love it!

5581,OfGbMdCnj-u3BTSPI,"Eating here was really the highlight of visiting Chicago. I came here with 2 other people on a Wednesday night w/o reservations and had to wait about 30 minutes. The food here is served tapas style, so its great way for you to sample their menu. We ordered a bunch of things like, Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg and the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. However, the one thing that blew us all away, made the long wait worth it, made the trip to Chicago tolerable and change all of our perceptions of how pork can taste is.....wait for it....wait for it....the Pork Blade Steak with Nduja & Honey!! If you go to the Purple Pig you have to try this item on the menu. I guarantee that you will not want to share. Oh and for dessert go for the Affogato {Shot of Espresso over Espresso Soft Serve}!",N
42730,vhEZP9ER5skTu--En79Xgw,"A few of my friends and I are bidding Chicago adieu, since we recently graduated college and are moving to various cities across the country. I'm moving to DC, which is a fun city but has a relatively less impressive dining scene in comparison to Chicago, which I will definitely miss. As a last fine-dining harrah, I chose for us to go to Longman & Eagle, a one Michelin star rated gastropub in Logan Square. We had a group of 5 and wanted to eat on a Saturday night without the requisite two hour wait, which are difficult requirements to fulfill. We managed to arrive at 5:30 and were immediately seated, although the restaurant definitely filled quickly soon afterwards. We all started with drinks. I asked for a recommendation for something that is refreshing but not too sweet. I can't remember the name of my drink, but I received a delicious citrusy cocktail that was exactly what I had hoped for and more. My friends each ordered a drink as well and let me try theirs, but I liked mine the most at my table. The small plates were the highlight of our meal. We had some sort of fish with quail egg (I'm terrible at remembering names of dishes, and the online menu isn't updated). The fish was perfectly cooked and went so well with the melty egg. We also got the order of softshell crab, which is breaded and deep friend, but didn't taste at all heavy. The components just went together so well, and it is among one of my favorite recent dishes. There was a consensus that the meal went downhill from there however. I ordered the sweet corn risotto off the vegetarian menu since I didn't feel like having too much meat that day. It was very average and my friends said that I kind of asked for it by ordering from the vegetarian menu, but at the same time, I've been to other restaurants for vegetarian dishes that were stellar. This just didn't feel like it had anything interesting going on. One of my friends ordered the pig's head, which has a huge slab of pork sitting on a bed of risotto, and her risotto portion tasted much better than my dish for some odd reason. Other main dishes ordered at our table were the burger (decent burger but a burger nonetheless), scallops (also pretty good), and the house special of the day, which was coca-cola braised brisket. My friend ordered it on recommendation of the waiter, but this was the worst received by our table. Literally half of each piece of meat was fat, and the other half was still fatty to the point of almost slimy. The braise was not good and just made the meat taste strange. One friend tried a piece and spit it out because she thought it was disgusting, and my friend who ordered it just sat there, poking it and looking sad for the rest of the night. If I had his dish, my rating would've been lower. The meal went uphill again for dessert. We shared the cornbread churros (?), which tasted like cream puffs, as well as the trifle. Both were good but not stellar, but the desserts helped end our meal on a more positive note. Overall, I really appreciate the atmosphere of the restaurant. It felt very fun and had an extremely extensive beer selection, plus the service was top notch. However, because of our mediocre main dishes, I'm unable to give this restaurant a higher rating. It was still definitely an entertaining and memorable dining experience.",N

The waitress sits us right by one of the huge windows saying its not even sunny out. Lady, if your room is lit by the sun and you can read, the sun is out. As we asked her about the items we were interested in her answers turned out to be incorrect in both quantity and contents of what was in the order.When asked how many eggs were in each item she gave a RANGE!. What recipe doesnt use a specific amount?The food, while not what we asked for was very good, however not worth coming back for for someone who acts like this.

14689,9vTphe4Tyv5MxpLh6ai8gQ,"So normally I don't like to give any small business a bad review, especially one that has been so well established. My wife and our family have been to Glenn's 4 times. The first two experiences were excellent! The staff was friendly, the food was good and the service was very efficient. Would have been 5 stars all around. NOW for the most recent visits, in the last 6 weeks (both times were for brunch) The last time we went we never actually sat and ate. The hostess was down right rude. It was pouring out and we were with our two kids. We had asked if our 2-1/2 year old son could just sit at the bar while we waited for our table (there was about 4 seats open). She said NO. They had to leave them open for people who wanted to eat at the bar. We even offered to move if people came in. On top of which there were multiple tables open, she claimed those were for people with reservations. Now I am all for reservations, but we were there for more than 10 minutes and the tables never became occupied. Hey Gleen, you know if someone doesn't show up for a res, it is good practice to give the table away and then put the people with the res to the top of the wait list when and if they actually show up. Needless to say we left. The most recent visit was this morning. We were smart enough to make a res.  I will say there were several open tables that never became occupied and I there was a nice size wait too. The food was good, but the service and dining experience was just not nice. We had asked the server if our son could just have a little glass of cereal while we waited for the main food (which we had been given the last times we had eaten there) She claimed new mgt did not allow for this. When we ordered we had asked for 3 types of cereal for our son (he was very excited for this). We were told new mgt only allowed 1 cereal choice. The sever was polite, but not what I would call friendly. Needless to say, if you only care about the food then go. If you actually want service move on to another options. PS - Isn't it owned by a guy named Glenn? if so who is the new management? Was it sold?",N
16192,2VhGPedn8bLeNJxK,"Northern Italian gourmet. I first came here 5 yrs ago with an old roommate for his birthday. It's very hard to forget such a mysterious place. There are no windows. The decor is stuck in the 70's- which isn't a bad thing. There is a piano bar. It's quite amusing. This is full service Italian- I'm talking bread and oil, soup, salad, appetizer, entree. And if you can make it through all that,  there's dessert too. Expect superb service from waitstaff. This is an old school joint. Huge portions, heavy garlic, lamb, sausage and beef. However there are vegetarian options- but that just means pasta without meat. The food is excellent- very hearty. This is a trip- its a little vacation in a big city.

We did have an event catered by Fifty/50, and everyone raved about the cuban and pulled pork sandwiches (I wouldnt know since I'm vegetarian) but I can vouch for the goat cheese pita appetizer and the veggie panini.

Yes, sometimes I feel like their food is a little bland, and many times, I feel like I can't justify spending the money (I'm a cheap twenty-something), but in the end, these guys know what they're doing.  The fact that they've been around for 25+ years is proof enough that they're worth the hype. Some highlights: * Fantastic staff- really fun, super nice, great people.  I got take out yesterday and saw two of the servers dancing along to Amy Winehouse behind the counter.  Good times. * THE BEST VEGAN CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES EVER.   Buy them here fresh instead of at Whole Foods. * Along the same lines- Chocolate chip cookie dough peanut butter milkshake.  'Nuff said. Yesterday I tried a salad for the first time (I usually go for a more traditional entree), and feel head over heals for their Green Machine salad.  Seriously, everyone should try it.

I ordered a trout special; It was OK, portion size was small for $14. My SO ordered a chicken Caesar salad. Pretty hard to mess up, but we both agreed it was pretty gross. The chicken tasted like the Tyson's chicken you buy pre-cut at the grocery store, with some weird chicken injected flavorings. It was undeniably not fresh. The salad dressing could have made up for it, but it lacked any oomph that a Caesar should have. It was one of those meals where you leave feeling full, saying ""lets go eat somewhere else."" $50 lunch for 2 (which consisted of 2 lunch entrees and a drink each).  Way overpriced for what we got.

21521,DcV1mzB,"I anxiously awaited XOCO's opening.  And then.  Well.  I heard about the lines. I have an allergy to long lines.  (My allergic reaction is unpleasant, characterized by;   shifting from one foot to the other, looking around to get eye contact from anyone working, checking my phone for nothing, really, just looking for a link to the outside world, the world outside of this GOD FORSAKEN LINE, and whining.  I don't whine in public but the internal whine that happens whilst I stand in line would drive the sanest of persons' crazy.) So I stayed away from XOCO. (The ""it's just okay"" reviews made me feel okay about my decision.) Then I reconnected with a chef friend from my catering days.  We made a date for a movie and some eats.  Friend wanted to go to XOCO. I hadn't seen said friend in 3 years.  A long line would not be a problem since I'm sure we had much to catch up on.   The queue was minimal when we arrived.  Just enough for a few conversational teasers before we ordered.  I got the mushroom torta, guac and chips and churros.  I had already observed the complimentary water situation as we stood in line.  (If you've read my past reviews you know I am a sucker for this Italian water filtration that a few restaurants are offering.  Flat/Sparkling, no extra charge, no waste and a huge value-added item for the consumer.)  I was thrilled to see Chef Bayless offered it at XOCO. I took advantage. I will admit I was a little (ever so slightly) peeved when I arrived and saw I would be ordering and given a number, then left to find my own seating, which looked completely packed.  I was so wrong.   This is a tightly run ship.  You and your party will have a seat and hot food.  That's how the XOCO system works. (And, it really does work.) We got our number and sat and chatted.  Chips and guac and salsas arrived so we ate and chatted.  Sandwiches arrived (friend got the short rib) and all chatting ceased.  We ate in silence with the occasional look to one another of approval,  Rick makes one hell of a sandwich. Service was always available so we flagged down our nearest when we were ready for the churros.  I don't know if it was because I was already full from the chips, the sammy, or the shortbread cookies (we broke into those things quickly...they are a MUST...I'm not a shortbread cookie fan but these have changed my whole outlook on the genre), but once the churros arrived I was done. They just tasted like an elephant ear from any Taste vendor.  I would have liked it more if it came with a dipping sauce.  Friend says Chocolate.  I say Raspberry.

Nonetheless, a review is a review. So here goes... I started with, what I believe was called, the Gold Star Margarita. And it was delish. I'm pretty sure it was fresh lime juice, which made all the difference. Then we ordered the Tropical Tuna Cocktail and that was very mediocre. I didn't think the mango paired well with the guacamole. And as we continued to eat, I felt more like I was eating out of obligation of having ordered it, rather than because it was amazing. Then came the main dishes. I hear Bayless is known for his mole's so we ordered the Mole Trio, hoping to get a variety (it's the spice, no?). All three moles were sooooo blah. Nothing stood out--to either of us. I mean, I was really shocked. We didn't finish any of the three tiny dishes. We also ordered the Ocean Trout in Peanut Salsa. I'm pretty sure the trout wasn't fully cooked. It was pretty pink and sushi-like in the center. The peanut sauce was tasty. But it wasn't enough to make me want to devour the plate in front of me. So with all that being said, both of us had a C- experience. (at least we both agreed that we were very unimpressed). Could it be because we began eating at 10pm? Maybe the chefs were tired and the food was overcooked at that point. Not sure. But I'm not convinced that this characterizes the full menu as, like I said, so many people rave about it here.

I likely wouldn't order it again. My afternoon lunch was made by the fact that my awesome boyfriend had his hand on my leg while we are eating. I'm easy. What more can I say?",N

Their soups and carnitas sandwiches are great.  The prices are probably a little high for the casual atmosphere, portions, and get your own water place.

First of all, I need to go back to check out their cheese selection because I glanced at a few very delicious-looking ones! I only had the Tomato Basil soup with crusty roll for an early lunch. The soup wasn't as creamy as I usually have it, but it had a nice fresh roasted flavor to it. The roll tasted like it just came out of the oven. Slathered on some butter and it was the perfect accompaniment to the soup. I'll have to go back to try more from their menu, and also to shop a bit in the store section. Overall a really cute, quaint place. Reminds me a lot of places in Europe!",N

6428,alj4a258bsX7pB0yRiTqWg,"Miss Hannah D. was craving some red meat and was especially craving meat from Wildfire so on a snowy night we ventured over to Wildfire. Prior to my meeting with the fire I had heard good things and after reading the reviews I went in with mixed feelings. I don't eat a lot of steak or red meats so I wasn't sure what I would order. I followed the lead of my trusty sidekick and ordered the petite trio. However I got jumbo lump crab and some sauce on mine and also go a side of mashed potatoes. My tators were to die for and my steaks were pretty good to. However the ""jumbo lump crab"" was not so jumbo or lumpy. Made me kind of sad. Hannah ordered a twice baked potato with was quite easily as big as her head! Size doesn't scare this girl she quickly sank her teeth into it. We also opted for dessert, however, after receiving it we also received a small present we weren't expecting. No matter we returned it and received a nice credit on our bill. The manager was very apologetic but I just couldn't stomach anything else. Our martinis were very good but service was a little on the slow side. It seems that our waitress paid attention to everyone around us more than she did us. (Did that make sense) All in all the food was pretty good but I was expecting something more.

Speaking of bucks, the place is CASH ONLY but there is an ATM inside. It seemed more fast food take-out than sit down restaurant. Maybe people are billing it wrong? The tortilla chips were sopping in grease, the ""chef's favorite"" Chicken Tiko was good, but nothing more than chicken and pepper shish kabob sans kabob. I loved the fried plantains but that's hard to mess up...and those oatmeal shakes you hear so much about...more like Horchata blended with ice and nutmeg...tasty, but not what I expected. Overall, the place is a Costa Rican version of La Pasadita...good for greasy burritos and tacos. And since they are NOW delivering, I might use this to sop up the next booze infused night.",N

We weren't that hungry, so we ordered the following: Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons and Parsley- SO delicious! It was pretty salty, but I loved that the charr brought new flavor to the cauliflower. I definitely have never enjoyed the usually bland veggie than I have at Purple Pig! Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- My friend said that it was ""life changing""...it was definitely delicious! The pork was seriously the most moist, pull-apart goodness that I have ever had. I'll never look at pork the same ever again :) Props for an affordable price point. College-wallet friendly yes!

They must have been terribly understaffed, because waiting was pretty much how we spent most of our time. Good thing we're in love. We were quoted a 30-minute wait time, which we were OK with; we went for a walk and got a bottle of wine. When we got back we were told another 20 minutes, and by the time we actually sat down it had been a total of 60 minutes. First rule of hostessing - overquote your wait time, never underquote. People get impatient. I've worked in restaurants, so I hate to be one of those people that tries to do the hostesses job, but it's frustrating to wait an hour when there are four empty tables in plain sight. The server was friendly but the kitchen was very slow, and while the food came out tasty, in the end it just wasn't worth all the hype.

We were seated quickly in a nice booth and promptly served cold water which hit the spot after a long day of tracking around Chicago. From my vantage, I got to watch the Chiefs in the kitchen preparing breads and other items in the ovens - nice. After I opened the menu, I was totally overwhelmed!! There are more than 300 items on the menu, so you can be adventurous if you feel in the mood. Doing the buffet, as others have recommended, is probably the way to go if it is available. For our dishes, I had Eggplant Tamarind and my partner had Chicken Palak with a Mango Lassi. The kid had an order of Chicken Dumbiryani. All dishes were OUTSTANDING executions! Mine was not too spicy and the eggplant was cooked to perfection! Our water glasses were constantly filled and they promptly cleared away the dishes when we finished. Also, they brought hot towels at the end of the meal to clean our hands - a nice touch and something I've not seen before here. If you want some of the best Indian food in Chicago, give this place a try. Enjoy",N
35236,nI,"OK, so, at the beginning of this year, I became a reluctant vegetarian. I miss bacon A LOT. I miss encased meat products. I miss thick juicy steaks and baked chicken. This Thanksgiving, I am sure I will miss my great grandmothers gizzard gravy that I have eaten every year for the last  #*^%* years... but, more than any of those things I miss corned beef. Corned beef is delicious -- it's fatty, fleshy, pickled meaty goodness -- and I love it... errr.... loved it. I thought I would never eat corned beef again, and then we found The Chicago Diner. Now, we did go at about 3 in the afternoon, so we had no trouble getting a seat or parking, but that part of town is usually a bitch to park in or around, and I can see how if the Diner got even a little rush, it could be incredibly uncomfortable to wait for seating there. I ordered the Reuben, my hubby had the Polenta Lasagna. My Reuben was as good as any real meat reuben I have ever had-- maybe even better than many. As a side, I ordered tortilla soup: FANTASTIC flavor! The portions were tremendous. I was SO SO happy. The Lasagna, on the other hand, was really just a huge chunk of polenta (a peasant food that, for some reason restaurants charge an assload for -- here it was 12.99, kind of ridiculous) with herbed butter, on a bed of greens, topped with squash, zucchini, and purple onions...*yawn*. He ate it because he was really hungry but I probably wouldn't have. For desert we spilt  a piece of AMAZING chocolate pumpkin cheesecake -- so good it made me want to stand up on the table and sing. The bill was $31.00. Kind of high for a late lunch that does not involve the slaughter of another creature (which would have been much cheaper!) but worth it, I think. I love this place. Not a day goes by that I don't think about that sandwich I had. Dear Faux Reuben, Most Cleverly Disguised Bean of Soy, I will return for you again some day, My Love -- someday soon.",N

With things on the menu like sea cucumber (and no, it's not a vegetable) or Jellyfish food is an adventure once again! I had a great time at this restaurant, going with a group of friends and ordering all separate dishes, putting them in the center of the table and enjoyed the myriad of different foods. The chilly fish was delish, the vegetable soup was a little salty (but good), the duck's tongue was... I've never had duck's tongue before so I'll say it was an experience, and for the less adventurous, the Mongolian beef and garlic chicken was really good too (weak in the knees). the service is OK, but the presentation is out of this world... or at least out of this country. I would suggest that you get there early or reserve a seat because they get packed! If you are driving, there is only street parking so be careful where you park.",N

It's a huge restaurant and they did seem to be quite busy with a large group in the back. It took them quite awhile to get to us and to take our orders. We asked to have an additional duck added to our order. After about 20 minutes (some people had food already) they came out to inform us they had no extra ducks. This would have been fine if they had told us this initially, but at this point we were all quite hungry after watching some of our friends finish their food. When the ducks did finally come out they were delicious. It was my first time with duck and I really enjoyed it - particularly the fried rice. It's BYOB but with a corkage fee as they have a full bar there. Aside from the service issues, the food was all quite good and I will go back, but with a smaller group and ensuring that we requested the exact number of ducks ordered.",N

We had the rattlesnake dog (FAVE), foie gras/duck sausage dog (WORST, almost wanted to spit it out!), smoked debreziner (small red sausage that was really tasty with the toppings) and a corndog (best i ever had).  Also the much acclaimed duck fat fries which were 100% disappointing!  DO NOT waste your time in line on a Fri/Sat just to try these fries, it is NOT worth it!  McDonalds has better fries!  Seriously, they weren't even salty and had no flavor, they were just maybe a little crispier than other fries.  Nothing special at all.  However, I didn't want to waste stomach space on fries anyway since we had 4 dogs between 2 people, so I was fine without them!! Hard to choose from all the specialty dogs, wanted to try them all.  If I ever go again, will go with a larger group so can sample more dogs.  I doubt I'll make it to Hot Dougs more than once a year just cuz of the crazy wait involved, but it is definitely worth going to check it out even just once. PS: they ONLY ACCEPT CASH.  i don't know if this is common knowledge, but i surely didn't know...good thing my bf always has cash on hand!  There is no ATM around so you'd be screwed after waiting in line for hours if you weren't prepared.",N

I started having these horrible visions that because my stomach was so stuffed that my belly button would become and outtie and under the stress of of my tights, I'd hook the spandex on my busted belly button and get a run in my stockings. Yeah, I know... pretty messed up, right? That's how much food I ate. Anyway, I took the BF here for a taste of romance and since I can't offer to cook for him because of my less than stellar cooking skillz, I figured I could sort of play this off. We had never done fondue before so it was defo a learning experience. The food was all delicious, our servers and even bus boys were entertaining and really went above and beyond to make sure we had a great night. We enjoyed the cheese appetizer, the BF got the scallop meal, I got the veggie meal (which I will say is overpriced for just a handful of veggie pieces- FYI), and we got the dessert plate full of marshmallows, pound cake, grapes, apples, strawberries, and pineapple, and a pitcher of sangria. We enjoyed everything but overall, I think it will likely be my last venture into fondue... well, maybe I'd be up for just an appetizer int he future but, the thing is, I'm a lazy person and the kind of person who just likes to enjoy the actual eating portion of dinner, not the cooking. The whole date reminded me of the time I thought it'd be cute and fun to go rock climbing on a date... until I realized how much f*cking work it is. It was all just very stressful and sh*t kept falling off my skewers, I kept having to try and fish things out of the oil, Operation style, with the skinny azz skewers. It just helped me realize that cooking, in any capacity, is not my thing. It is romantic though. The lighting, the decor, the curtained booths... it would have totally set the tone if I hadn't eaten so much that even I was scared to see myself naked as I changed into my PJs that night. I'd say it's a great place to stop for an appetizer plate before a movie but not something I'd want for a full meal before a date. Between all that cheese and oil, I thought I'd have to be rolled outta there. Seriously, if there had been a fire, I wouldn't have been able to get out in time, I was moving so slow after.

Well, this weekend things were different. I walked up the Glen's diner Sunday morning with the eye of the tiger. Victims this trip were the corned beef hash and eggs, and blue star crab cake benedict.  Corned beef comes out, and I'm like ""what the, where's the eggs"". They were hidden under REAL corn beef AND real diced potatoes. It was very good. Nothing mind blowing, but  the use of real fresh ingredients is ALWAYS a plus. I have actually never seen real chunks of corned beef used. woohoo! Add some hot sauce and pepper to kick it up a notch. Crab cake benedict was very good as well. When it came out, it looked kind of small, but I was barely able to finish it. Crab was fresh and flavorful, but they could be a bit more generous with the  hollandaise. I heard the mimosas are the booooomb, and they looked to be very good also. Key ingredient, triple sec. They come with your own personal bottle of bubbly too (very small, don't get excited).

When we arrived, my boyfriend and I were in a celebratory mood and wanted to have some tasty food, good drinks, and just have a fun time.  After drooling over the menu for a few minutes, the waitress came over and we started off with a drink order.  We ordered a $15 sour beer (the name escapes me) expecting a 750ml bottle to share.  Turned out to be a normal sized beer so we sent it back because come on, who spends $15 on a regular ol' beer?  I think she was annoyed with us from then on, but that didn't stop our experience from being great. We started with the buffalo frog legs which were the let down of the meal.  They tasted just like buffalo wings paired with some sort of airated blue cheese.  They were fine, but I regret not getting the meatballs and polenta to start. Since everything on the menu sounded amazing, we decided to order and share 3 small plates for our meal.  Great decision.  We got to try lots of great food - great quality, expertly prepared, delightful dishes. They had one dish come at a time which was just perfect.  We got the Seared Maine Scallops first and they melted in my mouth.  I wish there were more!  But minutes after we cleaned that plate came the Quail and Dumplings.  Delightful.  The best dish came last - which was a recommendation from the waitress.  I never thought I'd say that I loved me some pig head, but holy smokes this dish stole the show.  If you go, you MUST try the tete du Cochon.  You will not regret it.  Wow, it melted in my mouth, the 5 spice mustard sauce was so good that I want to sneak in at night and steal the recipe.  Wow, just wow. We had a little room left so got some dessert.  Another suggestion of the waitress, the banana bread pudding (not sure if that is the exact name) but this dessert was the perfect end to a perfect meal.  I told the table next to us that they had to order it. I dig this place.  The dining room is the perfect size, the staff is friendly enough, you can see the barage of chefs working in the open kitchen, they carry a good drink menu (with much more than just whiskey), and amazing food.   If you want a really good meal, check this place out.  You will leave happy.",N

This door person stopped us from entering and asked if we had reservations and of course being our first time in Chicago, we replied Do we need reservations to dine here? and the door person did not respond.

And hopefully if I ever go to Chicago again I hope not to see a sign at this establishment stating NO MEXICANS",Y
55974,V22DU5QE,"This place is good but not AS good as everyone had warned me about. I think it's because I measure how good a diner is by how good their pancakes are and I wasn't very impressed with Wishbone's cakes. The Denver Omelet I had was pretty good. Big chunks of sausage and the cheese distribution was perfect. Our waiter suggested next time to substitute the cheese with cream cheese.. it's supposed to be amazing that way. This place serves grits. Enough said there. This place does NOT serve corn beef hash. Enough said here. I really liked our server. I've actually been here twice and placed with the same server both times. He was pretty friendly, gave me free coffee.. 3 cups of free coffee. Downside of Wishbone is the long wait (especially weekends) and price. Food IS good don't get me wrong but I think I have had better for less.",N
45557,JAXlbeH1jvK6NCq,"We had one last Bonsoiree Groupon that expires at the end of the month. Yikes! Better hurry up and use it.  Better use it tonight! We arrived for our 5:00PM early bird senior citizen reservation and were sat at a table near the door. I'm pretty sure this was the first time I have ever sat in the dining room.  I love dining al fresco on their patio!  Then again when it's 15 degrees outside, I suspect the patio wouldn't be all too comfortable.  The interior space is minimal, but comfortable.  It's apparent that Boinsoiree's focus is what's on the plate and that's quite all right by me. On Sunday's Bonsoiree does a four and seven course ""no menu"" tasting menu.  We opted for the four ($45).  The first course was shell fish bisque with braised rabbit ravioli. The bisque itself was packed with flavor and surprising amount of heat.  The ravioli filling would have made Roger Rabbit want to eat himself.  It was rich and beautiful.  The only problem is that there weren't more of them.  The plate was garnished with sumac and some really yum-alicious caramel popcorn.  The second course was a mixed green salad with anchovies, cured salmon, beets, pickled rutabaga and a sweet-ish dressing.  It was well balanced and tasty. It wasn't a homerun, but a solid line drive in the gap.  To keep up with the baseball references, the third course was a no doubt 450 foot bomb over the center field fence.  It featured braised lamb shoulder, lamb sausage and lamb tenderloin with potato confit and melted leeks.  Each bite of lamb was better than the one before. Well seasoned, well balanced and just perfect for a cold winter night.  This dish was a beautiful fusion of heart y comfort food and sophisticated flavors.  To finish the evening we were served a raisin bread pudding with chocolate, hazelnuts and raspberries.   The service at Bonsoiree has always been excellent and this evening was no different.  We've had the pleasure of dining with Patric before and he's the best.  He's knowledgeable, super charismatic and makes you feel comfortable.  For the money, I'm not sure you can get a comparable meal with this level of service anywhere else in the city. The next time we go back it will be for the thirteen course menu.  Can't wait.",N
40000,sSzC13k2zXj1Bxb2lGZ5-A,"What can I say about this place? I am a breakfast junkie & try as many places possible in the city. What keeps me coming back to Meli is their quality of food. Whether your palette gravitates toward sweet/savory, you will find a dish you'll enjoy. Omelettes are excellent & well portioned, especially served with baby reds. Fantastic crepes,stuffed french toast & pancakes. Amazing honey butter & marmalades that accompany the yummy toast. Lavazza coffee they serve in unlimited quantities is GREAT. Service is ok, but it doesn't deter me from returning. Street parking is hit or miss & try to avoid peak hours. I've discovered anytime before 9:30am on the weekends have resulted in zero wait time for 2 people. Give it a try.",N
33823,wU5hd1Td0,"As stated before, super pricey, but as a special occasion, it's worth it. Ordered bone in rib-eye and split it with a friend...they split it into 2 plates for us which as a great surprise. Grill Asparagus was on par and what you would expect at a steakhouse. Order the Butter cake for dessert, it was recommended by Bill (our server) and was the best dessert on the menu. Service was top notch. Bill was knowledgeable and super friendly.",N
41763,ggY3LtM7ll4ROfLX0jfoyQ,"I was on vacation in Chicago for a few days this week, and insisted on real Chicago pizza.  My partner suggested Giordano's. It was a Thursday night, so I couldn't believe the crowd that was there.  I put my name in at the desk.  She told me to order my pizza at the counter on the right in exactly 35 minutes.  Then, by the time they had a table (probably 30 minutes later) my order came up.  Damned if it wasn't true, just like she said. If not THE best stuffed (deep dish) pizza I've ever had, it's close.  And service was very attentive when we got to our table.  But standing in the middle of that crushing crowd was no fun.  It's just a very popular place with a great system.",N
35120,ifpYMTQ5qf8J9hBoEwiKoA,"I've been going to the Chicago Diner since the 90's and am very sad to say they have lost most of their appeal. The menu has changed a lot and is now packed with processed food. The food is still okay, it's just not what it used to be. They used to have a delicious tofu scramble with tahini, soy sauce, sesame oil and sunflower seeds. They served it with a side of steamed kale and corn muffin. It was, in short, my favorite meal of the 90's. They have long since stopped serving it, and even their corn muffins are a different recipe now. Although I am sad about the slow decline of the Diner, I still do respect their long years of serving Chicago vegetarians. Also, they have very tasty desserts.",N
27827,obCqIOD0mP018hwbkg-T8g,"This month's dining excursion coincided with the arrival of some friends. Mercat a la Planxa, which features an Iron Chef, is a Catalonia-based Spanish Tapas place. We all went with the prix-fixe menu, which featured an amazing array of food. Our service throughout was exemplary, which is not something I have come to expect from Chicago eateries. The decor was rather over-the-top and somewhat 70's feeling, with a sunken dining room, making the bar and kitchen look elevated. The Chef Jose Garces was walking around, talking to the various tables throughout the night, which was very nice. Course #1: We started with a Bruschetta-esque entree on thick toasted bread. It literally hit all five tastes, and was of a sufficient enough portion that one slice was enough for several bites worth of this. I actually liked it a lot better than bruschetta, because it had an excellent array of spices on it. Additionally, they served very thinly sliced Chorizo sausage along with a light mustard, sliced yellow peppers, and gerkins. The chorizo was flavorful but not overpowering, and sliced so thinly that it didn't end up being filling. Also, they served us little dumpling-sized bits of a ""Spanish Omelette with Spinach, Potatoes, & Saffron Aioli"" -- this was just amazing, and even one of our friends, who truly hates spinach, ate this. It didn't actually taste very spinachy, but it was incredibly savory and while not particularly omelette-y, you could taste the eggs and potatoes very well. The aioli was a small dollop, but enough to be delicious. They also served us Manchego cheese along with a sherry/bacon powder sauce that I personally didn't like, but everyone else adored. Finally, they brought out fried pimientos de padrom, with salbixada and sea salt -- small green peppers with a very, very light mustard sauce. I'm pretty sure I ate half the allotted amount. Course #2:   We were served dates, wrapped in bacon, stuffed with crushed almonds, and then for the final decadence, a cheese fondue sauce was poured over the top. They then brought out ""Patatas Bravas"" -- spicy potatoes with spicy paprika aioli. Seriously, these were one of the best items of the night -- tiny little bundles of mmmmm. They served us ""Arroz con morels"" -- morel mushroom bomba rice, fava beans, green asparagus & lemon oil. An odd consistency, but seriously delicious. Then, they brought out ""Gambas al Ajillo"" -- simply, garlic in browned butter, served BOILING. The shrimp was hella hot, but sooo good in the simple butter. I used the toast the served it with to sop up the sauce, and would have poured it into my mouth directly if I could have done it and not looked like a TOTAL idiot. They served us a flatbread, ""Costillas de ternera"" -- beef shortribs, horseradish, parmeson and bacon. As one of our friends said in surprise, ""Hey, this has a bit of a bite!"" -- it was an incredibly complex bit of food in terms of taste, with a bit of spicy, a bit of tart, a bit of everything. SO GOOD. Additionally, they served us ""Conill amb chesnut"" -- braised rabbit agnolotti, Rosemary, Truffle-Chestnut Puree, and brandied cherries. This was very ravioli-i, with a very interesting foam on top (the puree) that had a lot more flavor than you'd expect. Course #3: For the main course, which doesn't have the awesome descriptions that the above head but does not take away the amazing quality of the food, we had: ""Colorado rack of lamb"", which I am pretty sure everyone at the table pronounced as the best lamb they'd ever had; Some sort of beef-related product (we can't figure out if it was skirt steak, short ribs, or what; we are pretty sure though that it was the short ribs; and prawns, which were served with heads and tails attached (though I pulled 'em off, 'cause... yeah.) And then there was dessert. Course #4: We had SIX types of sorbet (approximately 2 teaspoons of each): Turkish Fig, Dulce de Leche, Chocolate Peppermint, Milk Stout, Apricot, and Coconut. Chocolate croquettes with creme anglais (AMAZING) A chocolate mousse goopy thing with vanilla ice cream on a wafer An orange creme with some sort of citrus compote (that orange creme was something special) Rice pudding with another sort of creme and a citrus compote Finally, at the very very end, in a ""just one more little mint, Sir? it's wafer-thin!"" they gave us a pomegranate chocolate cookie thing that was about the size of my pinkie, and it was a wonderful end.",N

12197,mN,"Went to brunch today and must say that it is my favorite meal of the day!  I have not been to bongo room in a while but it did not disappoint at all.  The selection of decadent pancakes, french toast, to flavorful breakfast sandwiches, and over stuffed lunch sandwiches was like a cornucopia.  So much selection!  Since I went with a large group today I got to taste a lot of the menu!  At least 5 items.  But by far the must of today was the banana peanut butter chip pancakes.  The buttermilk pancakes covered with a sweet banana cream sauce drizzled with a chocolate peanut syrup and sliced bananas was orgasmic.   When we got there there was no need to wait we were seated immediately, the service was beyond what I expected.  We hardly had to ask for anything besides the check.  The server was thoughtful and even a savior because one of my cousins had forgotten his iphone in the restaurant and she literally chased us down just to return it!  Honest people, that is something I can appreciate. Satisfying food + Superb Service = Happy tummy and wallet.",N

7311,AMm7Iijc8Ouzq169HMiVSg,"I do not like giving out 3 stars because it does not help the reader when making a choice to go to a place...and I was really on the fence for Chicago q...so I decided to bring in simple math.  I made a list of everything I experienced and gave it a 5 to 1 stars and then divided it by the number of categories.  Drum Roll Please.... Chicago q came up with 3.88235294 Stars!!!  I told you I used some math.   I will break down my categories that brought me to that number. (score - category - description) 5 - Service - Our waiter Brandon was so cool and laid back...he never rushed us, in fact, we were eating dinner for like 3 hours. 5 - Decor/Comfort - It was really nice in here. We were sitting under the giant light well which gave us some nice natural light. The chairs were cushy too and that's why we sat for three hours...we didn't want to leave. 5 - Company - There is nothing like having a great dinner with a coworker and friend! 5 - BBQ chips - They were really good and a nice free treat. 4 - Bread & Butter Pickles - I don't even like Bread and Butter Pickles but these were really good. 5 - Four Sauces - Okay all of the sauces were so good. My favorite was the spicy one with the pepper flakes floating on top. 5 - Pulled Pork - It was really good...it was my favorite meat that we had on the table. 2 - Beef Brisket - It seemed uninspired to me. My friend loved it and it was his favorite. 1 - Pulled Chicken - Really boring and not very tasty.  We both agreed that this was our least favorite meat on the table. 2 - Corn Bread - It was just dry. I love corn bread and I was not a fan of what we were served plus we were given one small piece of butter on top of 3 pieces of corn bread. I needed like a bucket of butter to make it taste good. 5 - Hush Puppies - Put cheddar and bacon in a round ball and throw it in the deep fryer, then it better be good!!! The spicy dipping sauce was also really good too. 5 - Arugula, Spinach, Bacon, Poached Egg Salad - This was one of the more creative salads I have had and it was really good too. I would not have this as a special salad but move it to the permanent menu. 5 - Baked Beans - These were a meal in themselves...I am quoting my friend, Peter W...I have to give credit where credit is due. My wife who tried leftovers asked if she could just walk in and get the baked beans. The giant pieces of beef really set these baked beans apart from anyone else. 1 - Award Winning Baby Back Ribs - I know that these ribs have received an award but I do not know why...maybe the same love did not go into our rack that we received as the rack that one the ribbon.  I am sad to say this but I make better ribs at home.  I think the dry rub was nice on the outside but I was not happy with the finished product of the meat.  It took a couple of days for me to really think about the ribs. 2 - Key Lime Pie - The crust was amazing but the filling they made was like a  whipped topping for Lemon Meringue.  It was light and airy and did not even have a lime taste to it.  I am a huge fan of Key Lime Pie and I would recommend you take this off of the specials because the filling is not that special.  This was a real letdown. 5 - Seasonal Four Berries served warm with Ice Cream - This was the star of the show.  I normally do not even like this dish but I was blown away by it.  Everything was so fresh and good...this needs to come off of the specials and be on the everyday menu. So that is how I came up with my rating...I had to bring math into this because I was really going to issue my first 3 star review and I couldn't do it.   Some additional comments about the evening. The service was amazing.  Brandon was great and he even put up with all of my questions and jokes.  This place is like fine dinning BBQ. If you have been to a BBQ place you usually place your order at the front window, grab a seat and wait for your name to be called.  This place is the complete opposite of that. The one thing I didn't like was that nothing was hot when it was served to us.  Maybe I do not know anything about BBQ but I would have liked something to be hot.  Every time we placed our order, our food arrived in under 2 minutes...I know that it is BBQ and it was cooked hours before but it would have been nice to have warm food that seemed to take a little longer to get once we placed the order.  I know call me crazy!!! I am not sure if I would come back here but if I did then I would get the pulled pork sandwich and drown it in the spicy BBQ sauce.  I would also add on an order of those baked beans. Also this place does not look like a BBQ place from the street.  In fact, I have been going by here in a car for the last 10 months and I had no idea this place was BBQ.  I thought it was some expensive french restaurant.  I do find it weird that you can not even smell the BBQ outside like you can when you go near any other BBQ joint.  So I was really surprised, when I read about this place on Yelp a few weeks ago!",N
12668,VMDm8Z8t3U2PET,"I have such an affinity for breakfast foods.  I have become a fan of the Chicago Brunch Blog, I mean when I saw the Facebook ad for the blog it was like a, ""Welcome Home, Brian!"" moment.  Love love love it!   Anyways.  A recent review of The Bongo Room talked about a dish that inspired me to immediately hit this place up.  And that dish was Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.  Ohmagoooood.  I love pancakes.  And ricotta.  This is like Heaven!  So the day arrives and I awake early in anticipation of eating at The Bongo Room.  When I get there I peruse the menu and alas the Pancakes are not there.  My hopes and dreams shattered I went on to the more savory dishes because I was in the mood for something on the savory side of life.  I knew it was meant to be with the Breakfast Burrito.  Holy frijole it was muy delicioso!  Eggs: Yum!  Guacamole:  Yum!  Side of Bacon:  Yum!  And the portions, soooo filling.  It was a spectacular dining experience for me and my friend.  I will definitely be back to try something sweet.  Because I could eat pancakes everyday.",N

We both had 1 egg and sausage. The eggs,scrambled, were slightly burned and almost cold. The sausage was the size of a half dollar and no thicker. It was totally tasteless. I ordered toast (ala carte) it was cold no butter was on the table, when I asked for some it was ice cold. I then asked for some jam for the toast, they only serve what is in season so all they had was apple butter, YUCK!The price for this totally forgettable meal was $21.00. Ramova grill here I come.",Y

43658,vmHyvP4PQi7dW4gVIFin2Q,"It seems to me that many bartenders have forgotten how to make a proper drink.  No I am not talking about fru fru red headed slut shots or the occasional mai tai, I am talking about cocktails that take you back to when whiskey was the star.   Greeted by a minimalist, grey exterior with nothing to signify that this is a bar or restaurant other than the words, Eat, Sleep, Whiskey and a sign hanging with nothing more than an ""&.""   The place is rather charming when you walk in.  Dark woods, a long bench style booth along one wall.  Bar seating along the other side, and a small kitchen.  Just goes to show, you don't need to be pretentious for wonderful food and drink. We started off with the roasted marrow bones, red onion jam, sea salt and sourdough croutons.  The marrow was wonderfully executed.  The texture was creamy and delicious and the red onion on top added a bit of acidity as it tasted like if they were pickled.  The croutons weren't really croutons like you think go on a salad, more like toasted slices, but perfect to smother all the marrow goodness. We next got the seared Maine scallop.  I have said it before and I will say it again, nothing is better than a perfectly cooked scallop.  It was served on top of a creamed corn type mixture with some jalapenos it looked like.  The scallop was perfectly cooked.  Seared on top to give it a bit of crunch, however inside was soft, moist, and delicious.   To wash it down I started off with an Old Fashion.  I have had old fashions at a lot of different places.  Some like to add too much ice, some like to serve the orange rine in the glass, this place kept it super simple.  Two perfectly cubed ice cubes (which the server said is actually pretty hard to do) with all the flavors of the bitters, orange, and whiskey blended in.  No rine in this drink.  Well done! For the main course I had the River Sturgeon with some sausage.  Awesome!  It was grilled, and tasted almost like swordfish.  It was served in a roasted bell pepper type of sauce that added some spice.  Overall it was a very savory filling dish for being seafood.  Enough so that I enjoyed a nice glass of Portuguese red wine alongside it.   My girlfriend had the monk fish.  Also very well done.  Hers tasted lighter than my fish.  Both fish were on the mild side.   Overall this was a great experience.  The service was great as well, and our server was very knowledgeable and had a great mustache to boot.  Gastro pubs definitely seem to be popping up more and more and I couldn't be happier.",N

27791,tFlULSix-FC9JCaeQFMqWA,"I thought Amada in Philly had ruined me for all other tapas - but flying to the city of brotherly love every time I wanted Spanish food was really starting to become unrealistic - luckily Mercat right here in my own home town opened! The menu is wonderful, and on both of my visits, we had amazing service and even better food.  The chef here trained at Amada (James Beard awarding winning restaurant) - and he is doing to same great things with small plates here that Jose Garces is doing there. The sangria is wonderful (really really wonderful), but they also have a fantastic grilled pineapple mojito that rocked my world.  If the menu looks overwhelming, do yourself a favor and just order the tasting menu, you will end up with tons of food and the best stuff the kitchen is doing that day. I am in love with the goat cheese and balsamic strawberries off the cheese menu, as well as anything ""a la planxa"" style.   Beware though, portions are not huge and prices are relatively high (which is part of the reason I think the tasting is such a great value), but the food is really well done and I don't think you could fine better tasting tapas in the city!",N

Meanwhile, the other foodstuffs looks delicious too, but a bit overpriced. I had the hombre burger yesterday, it was way too greasy. The fries were nasty (not fresh), fried but left and soaked in oil. They have Goose Island root beer here if you don't drink beer, and plenty of cocktails. Most other times, this place gets slammed. Even though the food and beer is decent, I can't say it's worth waiting more than a half hour. Luckily I've never had to wait more than half hour here, and yesterday we got a booth for 5 people right away on a sweet lazy Sunday evening.

64375,CUrSg7D0JzMyqacujgSKeA,"A friend recommended Sunda to my girlfriend and me a few weeks ago, and, given that we hadn't had a fancy dinner in a while, we decided to go.My first impression of the place was that both the dining room and bar were very well done.  It is certainly a modern, stylish place, but not to the extent that it feels cold or unromantic at all.  Additionally, the service staff at the front of the restaurant was incredibly welcoming.Unable to pick just a few items from the menu, we wound up getting cocktails, three appetizers, two main courses, and a dessert between the two of us.  The cocktails were solid, but the food was delicious.  In particular, the duck/daikon/egg salad appetizer was incredible.  It had very strong Asian flavors, but it was not overdone at all.  The duck (and there was an incredible amount of it for the price) was ridiculously soft, and the daikon was prepared to perfection.  The chef's signature sushi (I forget what exactly he calls it) was the perfect mixture of textures and temperatures.  The only small dish I would not wholeheartedly recommend were the oxtail pot stickers, which seemed slightly underflavored.  Perhaps if I hadn't had the incredibly rich duck first, however, this wouldn't have been an issue.Among the main courses, the sea bass was truly sublime.  My West Coast friends always complain that it's hard to get good fish in Chicago, but Sunda has certainly proven them wrong.  The beef ribs were good too, though, for the price, not exactly anything to write home about.  For dessert, we got the ""Ridiculous,"" which is essentially tempura-ed ice cream.  It was definitely tasty, though perhaps more of a novelty than anything else.All in all, it was a great experience.  In addition to the great atmosphere and food, we had an incredibly helpful waitress who put up with our flip flopping ordering tendencies way more than she should have had to.  I would definitely recommend Sunda for a date or for a classy night out with a group of friends.",Y

We got-- Beer.  Neither of us was particularly interested in the listed cocktails, so we just got beer. the bone marrow on toast-  for some reason I was expecting some kind of pot of marrow.  Nope.  We got three halves of bones and a bunch of almost-burnt toast and some fabulous onion jam.  I'm typically kind of weird about bones, but this stuff was sooo good.  It's fatty and flavorful and perfect.. And the jam is something I could eat every day. My husband had been mentioning the foie/liver dish, but I don't think he was disappointed to get this.   orecchiette with pork sausage- Wow.  So good.  We skipped the truffle pasta after my husband's comment that ""for twelve dollars, it's probably not actually truffles."" He meant that it's probably truffle oil.  We had shaved truffles a long time ago and the texture is so important to me.  I would have gone for the gnocchi, but we saw it on two menus yesterday and decided we could make it at home.  We're so glad we got the orecchiette.  It's spicy, oily, and awesome.  Get it. Hamachi crudo-  He got this.  It was presented beautifully.  I was reluctant to take a bite because it was a smaller portion (big for a crudo, small as a main).  I'm glad I did.  There was a little chilli oil and some chives.  It was delightfully clean. Pot roast with glazed vegetables-  The major disappointment of the night.  It came out BLACK.  Yes, that was intentional.  The inside was still juicy and really spoon tender.  I just really hated the charred outside.  He loved it.  Also, the root vegetables... What comes to mind for you?  I think potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, turnips, and all kinds of other things.  It was onions and a couple of pieces of sweet potato.   It was still really tasty, but my expectations were a bit different and I was disappointed. The coconut/mocha pie.  Delicious.  Amazing. Awesome.  I'm a dessert person, but we had eaten so much that I picked at his instead of ordering my own.  I should have gotten my own.  The portion was surprisingly very large (1/6 of a pie or so).  We devoured it. I'm sure we'll return to Gilt Bar.  It was really good.  We got all of that for about $103 before tip.

There were clusters of candles and chairs whose backs reached up to the ceiling.  We were seated in a cozy yet elegant high-back booth, and enjoyed the laid-back swank of this place for the duration. After a few cocktails and sweet-treats, I found that the champagne cocktail was my favorite (well, color me predictable).  Oh yes and don't miss the peanut butter/ bacon sandwich *droooool* It's not a scene bar or a trust-fund clubhouse, although it could be if it wanted.  The no cell-phone policy pretty much filters out the people that would ruin it's intimate urban charm.  This could be a clever move for a second or third date- it's an absolute panty-dropper.   Now I've said too much. ***UPDATE*** This place now has a really long wait, and they tried to seat us at a big ottoman where we couldn't face eachother (?).  Also, do NOT order the ""americano,"" it's the only bad thing on the menu.",N

50300,QKMdK3b8,"I've been here a couple of times just never got around to writing a review. It's at a great location in downtown Chicago, right on Michigan Ave, so kinda a tourist trap in my opinion. However, you can get a really good seat with gorgeous views of the city, so I really recommend coming here at night if you come. If you are into Cheesecake factory, this is like it's twin, but more of an evil twin since I prefer the food at CF. The food at Grand Lux is just a a okay, it's tasty, but not outstanding, nor has it ever gotten us grossed out. The bread is delicious, drinks and desserts are HUGE, as are all the portions. This place gets packed fast, but it's really big so you shouldn't have too much trouble getting a table. If you're visiting Chicago and you want some decently priced big portion, average tasting food, and some killer night views, this is your place.

38834,Ll8n2OSRJyYfmwFdeSfL9A,"After rave reviews on Yelp, LTH, and finally a feature on Meat and Potatoes on the Food Network, I had to try this place out... First night we stopped by, we saw that it was closed due to Health Inspector... my wife freaked out, but I just casually dismissed it as part of the rites of passage in any good Chinese restaurant.  (Sadly, it's true... you don't want to see the kitchens in Chinatown). Second time, we brought a few friends (Ayesa Y and Sage G) to have a meal, and we ate... and ate... and ate... oh man, did we eat. Ambiance:  From the outside, it looks like it's just a little take out shop, with nothing to it.  You walk in, and it's actually pretty nice!  Lots of seats, deep restaurant, every table/chair is pretty spacious.   Duck Dinner - $36:  A server comes by with a cart topped with a beautifully fried duck.  Proceeds to slice the duck in front of you into thin pieces of meat and skin, which are excellent.  Comes with four buns (gua bao) to wrap the duck into with some sauce to eat... oh boy, this was good.  Dinner also comes with duck soup (not significant duck flavor honestly) and duck fried rice (pretty tasty).  This could likely feed four comfortably, if you don't want to be bursting at the seems after your meal.   Butterfly shrimp:  Nicely fried, topped with a slice of pork/bacon, these were a good appetizer to enjoy.   BBQ Pork:  This is the primary reason we came, along with the duck service, and let me tell you... this did not let me down!  Skin was perfectly crisp, the meat was absolutely tender... Pricing was $5 for a small, $8 or $9 for a medium I think, and can't remember the large.  We ordered a medium, and could barely finish this along with the rest of the food. As a note, we ordered the three items (duck dinner, butterfly shrimp, and BBQ pork) and ended up with leftover rice, soup, some duck, and a few pieces of pork (that we just couldn't finish). Verdict: Very affordable, very delicious... well worth the visit!  We look forward to going back soon, as many of the other items looked quite good and really affordable as well!  But if you go, get some pork and some duck... you won't be disappointed.",N
1153,hQXBKoeuZSOuNgbKX1zlrQ,"Oftentimes we are bogged down in the dichotomy of overpriced ""high-end"" food, and dollar menu ""fast food,"" to the point where the middle ground is a hazy fog of bulk processed, frozen meals.   Hot Doug's stands defiantly apart from the norm and takes one of the simplest and most iconic foods in America and bridges a gap between worlds. There is almost always a line, no matter what time of day, and no matter what day of the week.  Anyone standing in that line will tell you that the wait is well worth it, and I couldn't agree more.  The courteous and helpful staff are more than happy to make the experience as painless as possible despite the renowned wait times, and although the line may seem long, the staff makes sure it moves fairly quickly. How many different ways can you prepare and present a sausage/hot dog?  Hasn't it all been done by now?  Surely Hot Doug's response to that is, a resounding ""never!""  Their unique ""Specials"" menu and seemingly odd combinations of ingredients ensures that your first trip to Hot Doug's is memorable.  And despite their popularity (or perhaps because of it), they continue to offer many of the classic varieties of sausage/hot dog for very reasonable prices. After Doug took my order, I was surprised at how easy it was to procure a place to sit considering how incredibly busy it was.  The food was brought out promptly, and the Chicago dog was as good as it gets, but the real heroes are the Specials.  The Chipotle Buffalo sausage with gouda cheese was certainly unique, and I heartily enjoyed every bite. Sure, the decor won't be winning any awards, the line looks a bit daunting, and I probably wouldn't eat here every day, but rest assured, the wondrously quirky food concoctions and friendly staff makes this a must-try experience for anyone in Chicago, whether they live there, or are just passing through.",N

58286,5bJPJXp5kI3VK20USWf0tA,"In the summer this is definitely the place to be! This is actually my second time coming to this restaurant. The first time I went it was spring and I went in for a quick dinner with a friend. I liked the food the first time, but this time was even BETTER. When I pulled up to the restaurant it already had a different look. They turned the front parking lot into more outdoor seating. There were tables and umbrellas set up. There was music playing and the place looked pretty lively for a Monday night. I opted to to sit in the back patio while I waited to meet a friend. The patio walls all have murals on them with scenes of Cuban life which made the room very colorful. They also had lights and other colorful decorations up. Our table was in a great spot. My friend and I both commented we felt like were were on someone's porch or living room. The chairs we sat in were large wicker chairs that had comfy cushions. Just next to us was a small white couch. I think I could've sat there all night just sipping away my papaya shake which was extremely tasty and fresh. We ordered the Timba sandwich to share. It was kind of a weird combo to us - swiss cheese with guava presereves/jelly. But, it was good. I thought it basically tasted like toasted bread with butter and guava jam. We also had the beef empanada, goat cheese empanada, tostones, maduros, and the papa relleno. All of these items were very tasty. I loved tostones and these were prepared just right with garlic sauce dripped across the tops. My friend loved her goat cheese empanada. I did take a coconut flan to go. I was afraid I was going home with gelatin like or overcooked flan like I usually get at places, but I was very wrong. I was delightfully disappointed! It was DE-LISH. It had the custard texture I really love. It was thick and sweet. When we paid the bill, my friend commented on how inexpensive this place was. We had gotten so much for so little money. The service was excellent. Our waiter was extremely friendly and upbeat. I definitely will be coming back this summer, hopefully with a larger group of friends. I noticed on the menu that they are BYOB. But, even better you can bring in your own wine or rum and they'll make a pitcher of mojitos or sangria!!

15540,IY3yPmo1Tuja56sl,"I went here on a crowded Friday night and put my name in for a table and expected to wait for 2 hours to eat a hamburger. I must say I am not a fan of the no reservations policies at these cool new ""buzz"" places. For me, the cool thing about Chicago, was that it never took itself so seriously. If you think you are going to need room for more tables build a bigger restaurant. Heck, I know it is not cheap to get a building in this area, but come on! So, as you can see I started out cranky. Well, I waited and my friend showed up and we stood at the bar and waited like vultures behind a couple we noticed was done eating. They were nice enough to give us their seats and we sat down. We tried the bacon popcorn, then ordered a pizza and a burger. I had the burger. It was good. I ordered one with pulled pork on top. I think the burger was 10 ounces. I have to say that I tossed the bun, ate the meat, and that was about it. The burger was giant, and pretty good, but I am not a fan of mega-burgers, so I wish they had something a bit smaller on the burger side. The pizza was good, but I like the pizzas at Small Bar a bit more although the options were quite good in terms of toppings. The beer was wonderful. I think they put most of the thought into this and it shows. All and all, a good place to visit, but I was not blown away. Perhaps when the crowds die down this place will be worth another visit. I love the logos, and wish they incorporated pictures of Lenin, Marx, and Che since they borrowed all that Soviet imagery in the logos to sell beer. By the time they called me, we were done with dinner and walking out. It was a fun place with ok food and great beer. When it becomes a part of the hood, I think it will be a great place to go.",N

25250,GuFn1YjZMzCfS-wqVrFVWQ,"For someone who moved to Chicago from NYC 8 years ago and has complained about the awful Chinese food here for that entire duration, I guess I should be held somewhat accountable for never checking out any of the restaurants in Chinatown. This past weekend, two friends and I headed to Lao Sze Chaun (only one in the group had been prior and raved about it) - myself and the other person (both NYers) were very excited to try what might finally be great Chinese food. The drive from the West Loop was really quick and although they don't deliver, its definitely close enough to me for a last minute Chinese food craving. Anyway, we pulled up to the packed, but very unassuming restaurant and were told the wait would be about 20 minutes. The place was split in terms of clientele - The Chinese contingent definitely boded well for a great meal. When we finally sat, we are all starving and the menu is ENORMOUS. Many of the things on the menu are very traditional and not really my cup of tea - however, after navigating the menu, I'd say at least 3/4 of it are very accessible for just about anyone who enjoys Chinese food. We settled on the following: Egg drop soup - some of the best I've ever had Green beans in spicy black bean sauce (appetizer) - perfect spice/kick and we housed the dish in like two minutes Pork potstickers - different than any I've had. Cooked perfectly (seemed to be seared then deep fried) and the flavor was phenomenal Spring rolls which I didn't sample (there were only two) Tony's Chicken with hot peppers (don't recall the exact name) but it was great quality white meat chicken battered and deep fried with spicy peppers - AMAZING Szechaun beef tenderloin - nice cut of beef, great array of fresh veggies, and a fantastic slightly spicy sauce Garlic chicken - only had a taste of this, but as the most ""Americanized"" dish we had it was head and shoulders better than any similar dish I've had at any Chinese place in the city. Service was efficient, nothing to write home about but that's the last thing we were worried about. There's tons of places to eat in the one strip where Lao's is located but I think my next trip to Chinatown will be right back to where the experience started! Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",N
20732,Ekpz9cIPiWctATq22mQ72g,"Rick Bayless knows Mexican food. I love his food so much that I had it two straight days in a row. The first day I had the cochinita pipil which is a suckling pig torta with habanero sauce. This is some super hot sauce but I kept munching away anyways. There is something about spicy pain I enjoy. I had to refill my water 3 times. The wife had Ahogada which was highly recommended by Yelpers. This has to be one of the best sandwiches I ever ate. A carnitas sandwich that is a inch soaked in a savory spicy tomato broth. I can only dream about a sandwich so good now that I am back home in California. for desert, we had the churros dipped in chocolate sauce. This was also good. The second day was our last day in Chicago. We narrowed it down Portillos or Xoco. Best dog I ever ate or best sandwich and mexican food I ever ate. The clear choice was Xoco since it was one of a kind restaurant. This time I ordered the special which was a pork belly torta and the wife had the short rib caldos. Today didn't blow me away like the first day but both dishes were solid. I recommend for the caldos to order a side of bread. It is so good to soak the bread in the soup. It reminds me of a vietnamese beef stew with french bread. For desert, we had the vanilla soft served ice cream with caramel and bacon. Everything complemented each other, sweet and savory.

I had to request a spoon for the first course and would have for the second course had our server returned. I had to send back the Wagyu Sirloin which was way overcooked for a medium-rare order. I was annoyed that the chef tried to pass it off as though it being Wagyu beef should be enough to keep a diner happy. This was my second visit and the first was similarly uneven. The noise level was awful at times. There's a whole tribe of people who scream across the table when they're in close proximity to a bar. I don't know whether it's the alcohol or the sight of a bar that brings out the screaming in them, but depending on where you are seated in this restaurant you may have to endure extreme noise over what attempts to be fine dining.

This brings us to the shining example of simple, fresh, deliscious, deep dish Chicago style pizza.  The best of the best is Gino's East.  The key is is the different crust that Gino's uses versus the competition. Now, you'll hear people go on about Connie's, Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and those are all fine pizzas, but they are NOT (in my humble opinion) the best of the best.  There is something special about Gino's East.  It screams Chicago! It's bold, it's unpretentious, it's simple, it's fresh, takes a back seat to no one and makes sense!  (Basically the complete opposite of New York) Stopping in the location is a very fun way to have a relaxed date night but you simply cannot beat this pizza.  It is by far my favorite of all time and I highly recommended!",N

The crowd in unassuming and they typically play sports on the several TVs around the restaurant and bar. I love sitting in the ""library"" where there are only four tables and you truly are able to experience a more intimate and laid-back setting. The first time I went here, I was unimpressed by the salty food. You truly have to choose the right options though because every visit since has been amazing.

21729,4ylpHe6ErNtKPpKaDcWEBw,"First and most important, Sushi to me was good, not excellent or ""OMG"" but good. I should note that typically I'm not a fan of sushi so it may take better than average to win me over. Second, make a reservation. I was one of the first to arrive for our party so we did wait until everyone came before checking in for our 8:30p reservation. That said, I was able to watch several groups walk in/out and get the response from the hostess that the wait will be hour or two. Of course, all seemed annoyed which I deduced from the eye rolls, arm movements, and language. Moral of this story is make a reservation! They also are more than happy to allow you to open your BYOB (awesome) beverage in the waiting section (only room for 10 or so). They do offer the ability to take your number and call you when a table is ready. Third, the bathroom is single use. Given the number of tables in the restaurant and already established high volume of patrons. This really was annoying. Also, our table was close so there would be 3/4 ladies waiting (felt like lurking) at any given time. Overall it was an enjoyable experience but felt a bit crowded in regards to table space, walking room, bathrooms and waiting area.",N

Maybe things were different two decades ago but I get better vegan food at a non-vegan restaurants that offer a vegan entre; for example vegan bi bim bop at a Korean place or falafel wraps at a Lebanese place. I just feel like there is way too much fake meat in everything. It's like I'm eating veggie slop. Also the desserts are so dense.  I've made so many vegan desserts at home that taste way better that what is served here.The service is great and there are some tasty foods. I'm not saying it is all bad.,Y
66609,HnejWiccG6wrARJUEyk67w,"First, I want to point out that I have over 17 years of experience in the service industry and I only joined Yelp to write this review. I have held just about every position possible inside a restaurant from bus boy to manager. I just got home from my latest and probably last visit to Gino's East. We arrived at Gino's East at 162 E Superior St. at 7:10 this evening. Upon our arrival we waited in line for what we were told would be about 45 minutes with a party of 5. I then experienced what can only be described as the worst ""wait"" experience and one of the most inefficient and ridiculous host/hostess operations i have ever seen. The host was not taking names but yet the number of people in your party and we were told to wait in line outside of the restaurant. This would have been fine if people were seated in the order of which they arrived, as is the standard practice of any other establishment, and if the inept host could have remembered any party in line. Needless to say our 45 minute wait quickly turned into an hour and then an hour an 10 minutes as we were continuously skipped over for parties of 4, 6, and even 7 people. At this point we were finally let inside the restaurant where we were told to sit in the lobby and wait some more. We were then skipped over by another party of 7, a party of 6, and a party of 4 who arrived about 40 minutes after our party. When we were finally sat down at our table it was about 8:30. This would not have happened in any of the establishments I have worked at. Especially an establishment that claims to be ""World Famous"". Our server came and he was definitely the only highlight of the night. He was attentive and the service was actually pretty good. We ordered our drinks, appetizers, and pizzas as soon as the waiter came to our table. The drinks and cheese sticks came out pretty quickly. however; I was still fuming from the experience at the host stand but I was trying to make the best of it. My expectation at this point would have been a table visit from a manager to apologize for the wait, thank us for coming in, and just show some sort of hospitality. This again is fairly standard in the service industry. No such visit occurred. After about an hour of waiting for our pizza I saw our server pull two managers into the kitchen. Upon seeing this I immediately said to my table ""They messed up our pizzas!"". Sure enough a few seconds later the server, not one of the managers, approached our table to tell us the bad news. He did say that the smaller pizza would be taken off the check however; after the long and ridiculous wait and now this mishap, a visit from a manager was expected. I was actually kinda of shocked that the staff didn't think of this on their own . When the pizza finally came out at about 9:45 a member at our table actually said to the server ""I know this is not your fault but we got here at 10 after 7 and we are just now getting our pizza."". We were hoping that the server would say something to the manager. He did not! We then quickly and quietly ate our pizza hoping still that one of the two managers would come over. This again never happened. We paid our bill and left very disappointed and quite angry. We will never be visiting any of the Gino's East establishments again unless something is done to rectify this situation. This is quite sad because you actually enjoy the pizza quite a bit. Here are some suggestions for Gino's East : Correct the issues with the host stand. Taking names is a great practice. This is why every other restaurant does it. It works. your system does not. Also, you might think about taking orders while people are ""waiting"" this would greatly improve your ""turn"" time Train your managers to be attentive to what's going on in their restaurant. Tonight they failed on more than one occasion. Last but not least...your bathrooms are disgusting. Instead of standing around, laughing, and leaning up against walls your managers should be making sure every aspect of the restaurant is running like a will oiled machine. This includes having bus boys clean and restock the bathrooms. Your restroom shouldn't smell like a stop on the blue line subway!",Y

They offered no help when we were trying to figure out what to order and how much to order. The family sitting next to us seemed to have the same problem after they started asking what we ordered.

4732,AeNCpbefA20CcsmmHSj8Qw,"I was so excited to finally go to the Green Mill. I met friends there the other night to watch the poetry slam. The bar itself is really awesome inside and the band that accompanied the poets was jazzy and impressive. I had a Bloody Mary and a Lemon Martini. The Bloody Mary wasn't as spicy as it could have been, but still had a very good flavor. The lemon martini was ok. The wait staff was very nice, but the person at the door collecting $6.00 for the show could have been a bit nicer, and have spoken to the people paying, and not have man-handled people who weren't aware that they had to pay. I was the first one at my table and as soon as I sat down the manager/bouncer lady swooped in and demanded to know if I was going to be the only one. I told her no, that I was expecting two or three more people. Throughout the first hour of the night she hid by the door and glared in my direction, waiting for the opportunity to remove me from the table if others didn't show soon. My two friends arrived and the woman appeared again, asking if we were expecting more people. When we said no, she snapped, ""I'll be seating two more people here then. This table seats five!"" and then stormed off. As the intermission of the show ended and the band geared up to play again, we sat in the back, very close to the exit, and talked amongst ourselves as people in the audience yelled out to the performers on stage. I don't know how this lady did it, but she appeared from the darkness without us noticing and demanded that we lower our voices and stop speaking as there were people on stage. Awkward. The show ended at 10:00 and we stayed at the Green Mill for another hour as everyone filed out of the bar. Swiftly gliding past, the woman placed a sheet of paper on our table explaining how patrons should remain quiet during the shows because of the musicians and performers on stage. Again, this was an hour after the show. The Green Mill was cool and all, but it seems some of the staff would rather give a big F-you instead of a Thank You for coming!",N
50780,3PZ8RuC-MJY4zML5Ms-Bzw,"Thanks to Chicago yelpers, we had a great dinner here last week. We were there at 5 PM. We were told that if we wanted the fabulous window seating, we would have to wait for 25 minutes. We would have to wait just 10 minutes if we wanted inside seating. We said that 25 minutes was fine, but we were seated in only 12 minutes. The view from the window was GREAT--well worth the extra waiting time. We started of with the duck dumpling. This was good with a spicy seafood paste. We order the mixed combo of mahi-mahi and shrimp scampi and the chicken royale and the braised short ribs. The short ribs were fork tender that it just melted in your mouth. The chicken royale was very tender. The shrimp scampi was garlicy. The mahi-mahi was flavorless.We were not impressed with this dish. We finished off with the beignets with the three sauces of vanilla, chocolate and raspberry. I also had a fresh lemonade and a hugh strawberry smoothie. Both were very tasty. When we left, the place was mobbed. I think the waiting time was 90 minutes. Our server, Rebecca was very sweet.",N
57666,Io7DRUVR0ZN,"I have been at this location many of times, but it does feel like every time I come here that service goes down. The last I was there I nearly waited 10min for another cut of meat after the first sausage that was placed on my plate. Normally you would get an endless line of Gauchos coming to your table but it feels like every time we've come especially the last 2 times the meat is on the verge of running out. They come out and its like the last of the meat, its cold. I could honestly say I may not be back here. And its not like its only 2 of us, every occasion Ive gone its been with friends and we've drop easily 4 or 5 stacks ( $500 ) so I would hope for better service. If management reads this; I would ask that you think back to your home ( Brasil ) and remember the dedication the Gauchos have for their food.  Making the restaurant classy is great and we appreciate it, but when it comes down to it I want that feeling I had when I was in Brasil eating and I think Brazzaz's is loosing that feeling. If you return to your roots, in the end its not about the glasses or table cloth's its about the quality of steak and service. Muito obrigado.",N

63697,j6EBnMWy8ZbL4Fw7V_SfKw,"The food's great and while the sandwiches can be considered pricey to some, the flavors are unique. You don't usually get the type of ingredients that they put into their sandwiches, so as long as you can appreciate it. On the other hand I'm sure there are plenty of people who would say I don't get the hype or I could just get a deli sandwich or $5 footlong - why bother for a sandwich. So, I'd say know what you're getting into. A tasty $9-$10 sandwich with unique flavors. The churros are also great, but again there will be some saying it's a churro. While I agree, it was probably the best churro I've had to date.For me, I really like the place, definitely think it's worth it (especially considering the premium you have to pay for either Frontera or Topolobampo) and will definitely be back. Be prepared for a wait if it's during meal times and you have to get a table before you can order your food, which is a little weird. Finally, if you don't care about sitting there, consider the to go option, where you can skip part of the line.All in all, Xoco's a winner, unique flavors, gourmet sandwiches, relatively reasonable prices.",Y

30868,yJQbaI-VFcjCAMfEs-Up0w,"Edit (05-10-07): Another of my bosses brought me here for staff appreciation week this year (I see a theme) and MAN! It was just as good as I remember. I gave it the 5th star back because our waiter this time around was excellent. Cazuela de pollo. Get it (if they have it by the time you check this joint out; I noticed that the milanesa de pollo is no longer on the menu, as it was replaced with pork milanesa). You will love it. So tender, so tasty, so filling! That's my story!! ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ Some places aren't exactly dirt cheap, but when it's a good restaurant...it doesn't matter. This place has such great food. I was taken here by 2 of my bosses for Staff Appreciation Week and man...what a way to appreciate me! By feeding me great food! We had an appetizer platter that included quesadillas, tostadas, and taquitos. They serve those up with sour cream and guacamole, making them oh-so-good. As an entree, I had the milanesa de pollo (breaded chicken) and it was to die for. They put this avocado-tomatillo sauce on it that makes the chicken taste divine! The only reason it loses a star is b/c our waitress rarely came back to check on us. When she did, she was super nice, don't get me wrong. But we were in a rush to get back to work and it would have been nice to have gotten our food and check a bit quicker. The food is excellent, though, and definately worth checking out!",N

Service was on top of it!  I got to try a lot of food as well so here we go.. My favorite appetizer was the Arepa-Berkshire pork, corn cheese cake, plantains, black beans, jicama, avocado, aji limo puree. (Yes I copied this from the online menu). The other apps we had were the Flores y Camarones Edible flowers, Mexican shrimp, corn tortilla, chihuahua cheese, tomatillo habanero sauce. I don't recall any flowers..and the salsa seemed more like a cilantro and hot pepper sauce. still good. Guacamole ""Kleiner Style"" Chunky avocados, cilantro, chiles, onion, garlic, lime, chips Yep just a good yummy old fashioned guacamole. I didn't like the ceviche selection, but that is just my tastes, so if like whats in the different ones go for it. Others at the table loved it. for dinner I had Costilla de Res- Braised short rib, Three Sisters Farm cheese polenta, carrot escabeche, spiced cashews. I could not get enough of the polenta! the short rib just fell apart. My niece had the Arrachera Grilled skirt steak, rice and beans, sweet red onion, chimichurri sauce. Yes I am reviewing this because I ate some of hers to. It was a good skity steak, but it was skirt steak none the less, I liked the marinade. Now my friends dinner... hers took the cake! I didn't see hers on the menu, so it must have been a special. It was cubed steak plantains, and sauces. I had forgotten how much I liked this place. I will be back.",N

We had a wacky but nice and attentive waitress. Everyone starts with crusty Italian bread and pizza bread for the table...free. Each person at the table also received a brushetta appetizers to try. All of our food and drinks came out in a very timely matter. While everyone didn't love the food they ordered, everyone thought that it was decent. We all got soup and salad with the meal for no extra cost, which is amazing. While waiting for our dessert, the waitress brought out a platter of fruit. It contained cantaloupe, watermelon and grapes. Unfortunately, we didn't eat much of it because we were all stuffed and barely had room for dessert. Most of us shared the Baked Alaska, but others tried the cannoli(made to order), chocolate mousse cake and tiramisu. Out of the 10 dinners, only 3 had a soso experience. Everyone else said that they would definitely go back again. I thought the prices were reasonable based on the amount and quality of food that we received. I will definitely return and hopefully on Wednesday for Lobster Night!!",N
63994,5bnbxr96lqTImbNRNTym_g,"This pizza is ok. It's not the best, but when you can get a Lou Malnati's deep dish for 10 bucks that's twice as filling, why go here? Oh, that's right...the bar. They have a bar and if you happen to walk in, you might get run over by a stampede of smoking 20 somethings hanging out on the corner or getting out of cars. Overall, apart from the price, this pizza isn't too bad, I just think it's overpriced. The pizza place next door that features new york style pizza offers more for the money (though that place is expensive as well, but the new york style pizza is authentic). Piece's claim to fame is that it's a Connecticut style pizza from New Haven, I think. So if you've ever wondered what east coast pizza is like, you have two options almost right next to each other. If you're not in the mood for pizza, then my recommendations are to head down to Division and try either Smoke Daddy or Picante - two of the best restaurants in this area. If you're looking for dessert, there's a cold stone creamery directly across from Piece.",Y

BBQ short ribs are the most popular items on the menu. They will not allow you to cook a single order BBQ on the table. Instead they cook them in the kitchen and bring those out to you. It's just one of the ways to push you to buy two orders and make sales. Also, when they cook inside the kitchen, they use the oldest marinated meat. Be aware!They jacked up the price, yet food got stinkier. No wonder you don't see many Asians or Koreans. It used to be place, but not anymore. Don't go there, its not worth it.",Y

And in case you are curious, no, I did not say anything to him or embarass myself.  It is weird how these cooking shows have made chefs into psuedo celebrities. So I came here with a friend on an early Friday evening.  The atmosphere is really relaxed and the bar was vibrant.  Started off with some cocktails; the tainted love and the london calling.  Both were really good, not overly sweet, well balanced without being too boozy.  Tried the tuna appetizer, salmon and scallops entrees, and strawberry shortcake dessert.  Delicous!  The scallops just melt in your mouth, and they were served with a pork hash.  The shortcake dessert was quite tasty, albeit tiny.  Don't plan on sharing dessert if you want more than a mouthful.

23566,iSHjKXw-KWTMIz,"I was watching a show on the Travel Channel the other day about infamous hot dog places across the United States, and Superdawg was featured. This reminded me that I haven't been to Superdawg in a while, so I made the trip. The pros: The winking hot dog statues on the roof are one of a kind. The food tastes great. The hot dog lounger boxes are quite amusing. The fact that they have drive-in stalls also garners points because it is just something you don't see much anymore, unless you have a Sonic in your neighborhood. All in all, a solid Chicago hot dog stop even if it is a little overhyped. The cons: Superdawg is hard to get to because it is at the intersection of three major thoroughfares. Getting in there during rush hour is tough. Not to mention, the popularity of the place makes it like a hornet's nest. There are cheaper places to get hot dogs and other greasy treats. The staple Superdawg comes to $4.86 with tax. (It is a jumbo dog and it does come with a few fries, but still that is pricey for what you get.) Keep in mind this is one of the cheapest items on the whole menu as well. I'd say everyone has to go to Superdawg at least once because it is a semi-famous hot dog joint. It would be a great place to take out-of-towners. The inaccessability and the fact that there are plenty of other great (and cheaper) hot dog places in Chicagoland make it not a habitual hangout for myself.",N

The entree.  I'm not a huge fish fan, so I ordered the filet and shrimp.  There is no way that piece of steak was a filet.  I'm guessing it was a strip steak at best.  The shrimp was waaaay overdone and chewy. Others at the table who did get fish dishes seemed to enjoy more than me.   Really enjoyed the sangria, I could've drank those all night.",N

Seriously, I've had better hot dogs elsewhere.  I'm not the sausage adventure type so I got a regular dog (after waiting eons in line of course).  If you can't make a regular dog the schnizzle, I can't say I'm all that motivated to go back to try anything else.  And their fries weren't even all that stellar.  It seems just because it's so popular, everyone thinks they have to love it.  Hm, over-rated. You have to devote a whole day to getting food from there since it takes forever to get in.  Not worth the line.  The hot dogs & fries at Tore's at Diversey and Western are far better.",N
55372,U-bx8n8,"Great little gem of a place.  Smaller menu but that is to be expected at a smaller local place - plus a small menu usually means what you order will be spot on and Big Jones did not disappoint. To start I tried the Split Pea soup which was delicous, though I don't think it rated the $9 price tag.  The Crawfish Fritters were perfectly crispy on the outside and crawfish deliciousness on the inside - serviced with a spicy drizzle of sauce that was just right. The entrees we tried were the Shrimp & Grits, Migas, and the crab cake eggs benedict - each was simply perfect.  The two egg dishes came with some delightful hash browns, seasoned and cooked perfectly. Loved the decor, very comfortable and cozy but elegant.  Great for dates! They have a large selection of teas and a few choice beer selections.  The service was just okay.  We were the first patrons of the day and our server was just a bit off, which is the only reason I am sparing them the fifth star.",N
40513,9uo8gr8yUMbCwLgPHs6CMg,"Hopleaf has been on my list of places to try for quite some time.  I've put it off because I'm generally not in the area, and after reading the reviews about the pretentious staff, I thought, maybe it's not the place for me. Jury's still out.  We went to Hopleaf last night for a late (9pm) dinner after exploring the city for the majority of the afternoon.  We were greeted right away by a server in the front bar area, who let us know we could either sit in front and order from the bartender, or see the host toward the back for full service (what is this, a gas station?) We walked toward the back, as I was hopeful for a table on the patio.  When we were told it was a 45 minute wait (and the kitchen was only going to be open for about that long) we opted to sit inside, and did so immediately. It seemed to take our server a bit of time to get to our table, maybe because we were in the corner?  In the meantime, we were able to choose beverages from the extensive menu, and take in the décor.  I loved the exposed brick and antique artwork. To drink, I had an Original Sin cider, which is from NYC.  It was light and crisp, just what I wanted, nothing heavy.  My counterpart had a Manheur (sp?) #12, which is dark, but not heavy (I found it comparable to a barley wine.) Neither of us were very hungry, so we decided on the mussels for two, and we told the server we'd split a salad, but hadn't decided on which one.  The mussels came out very quickly, and were very tasty.  We ordered the Belgian style, the traditional way.  I love mussels, people.  They *might* be my favorite shellfish (don't tell the oysters.)  They were served with a cone of frittes with garlic aioli, and three large chunks of assumingly fresh baked bread for dippage. The server checked on us a few times, but didn't ask about the salad until her third trip back to the table (when we were finished with the mussels/frittes).  Had she asked the first time, I would've ordered something, and probably another beverage.  But all she said was (while both of our mouths were full) ""everything ok?"" and as I nodded, she turned on her heels and was gone.  Well, her loss for not up-selling us? It was not jam packed busy as some other reviewers have mentioned, maybe we got in at the right time, late on a Sunday?  The mussels were very very tasty, and I'd like to go back for a full meal someday.",N
45434,SDCJ7AnKLiQ5UtiIQ,"My coworker told me to go here.  So I took his advice.  The steak here is fabulous.  The meat comes sizzling in butter to your table.  It's still sizzling.  You do smell a little like meat after it, but it's so tasty.  It was the best steak I had.   Very fancy.  Nice atmosphere and a great waitstaff.   Also, the extras are great too.  We ordered the mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The asparagus was the best ever too.  For regular mashed potatoes, they were excellent.   Everything seemed to melt in my mouth.  If you love steak, you must come here and enjoy theirs.",N
28141,1MIW3Hen,"A friend took me here for my birthday. This was my first fondue experience, so I am going to make my first Yelp review talk about my first fondue experience. Atmosphere: The waiter was impeccably professional, polite and entertaining. They had a wonderful flamenco guitarist to provide background music. The room is dark and romantic, even if you are a little too close to other people's tables. Food: The cheese fondue was probably my favorite part. I would have been happy to eat that all night. Cooking the meat in oil was fraught with problems for my overanalytical, perfectionist side--what if I leave it in a little too long??? Does this look done??? But you can't fault Geja's for that. Chocolate fondue for dessert was delicious, as was the little cake they gave me for my birthday. Price: A little pricey, but they give you a $25 gift certificate towards your next meal with the check, so that eases the pain a little. I'll be back any time I can find an excuse.",N

Did you hear that first part?  Duck confit eggs benedict!  With spinach! What the hell else needs to be said?   OK, a few other points:  Our server was perky and polite, but didn't hover.  The bartender (ok, we hung around for post-brunch adult beverages) knew her way around a wine list quite nicely, and they have ample parking.   As a side note, we began to notice lots and lots of families with young children walking in the door.  While our concerns quietly mounted, we oddly heard no over the top toddlers screaming nor overly gushing mommies and daddies convinced they are the first in history to reproduce.  It seems there was a singer of children's songs on the stage in the back room.  It was clearly a riot for the parents and their children, while those of us talking sailor talk in the bar couldn't hear a peep of it!

Second, everything ran pretty smoothly.  From reservations, to getting in there, even to waiting past our reservation was ok, we were hanging out at the bar, where the ""amigo bartender"" made me a delicious raspberry mojito!  Drinks are quite expensive thou. It was a very pleasant night.  The waitress was very nice and helpful.  I looked at the menu to see if they had some Brazilian dishes, but as much as the waitress wanted to convince me I know that 'Jambalaya whatever dish' is NOT from Brazil.  So yeah, Brazilian options won't pass the famous Caipirinha or Caipiroska ( when vodka is used instead of cachaca). Jeremy and I followed the set menu for restaurant week. He picked the bean soup (which was delicious) and i picked the argula salad (delicious as well). For entrees we had the sea food stew, and the pork and cabbage with rice. Very Cuban this last one, heavy dish, and it took me a while to finish. Still, everything was delicious. For desert, I had the pecan cake and hubby opted for cinnamon flan.  We agreed that the cake was way better than the flan. The result was that everyone wanted my cake. - I think this sounds a little dirty. Fun night with friends, i LOVE the restaurants colors and vibe, and the way tables are set up. Thumbs up! :)",N

We waited almost an hour but it was worth it.  Not the greatest service but who cares the pizza makes up for it!  And they do let you pre-order while your waiting so you don't have a long wait at the table.

We started off with an appetizer and went with the Empanada platter as it was suggested by a friend prior to us going.  They arrived quickly and were very flavorful.  I think the cheese ones were my favorite.   I ordered the churrasco (butterfly cut, N.Y strip steak) because I've had this at other latin  restaurants.  I have to say I really enjoyed it.  Not the best I've ever had, but it was really enjoyable and very juicy.  It was served with fried sweet plantain, yuca, and potato, and all were on point.   The only negative really was the salad I got which just wasn't good.  However the salad was the last thing that I went there for anyways.  This place is also a bit pricey, but that was to be expected.  It was also a voyage to get to the bathroom which included going downstairs, and down halls and around corners.. felt like a six mile hike.   I went with 4 stars which seems to be the average.  It isn't the best place ever.... but you surely wouldn't go wrong trying this place out... especially for a date.",N

33252,eHiR7g4cVxOBfnQOlR,"Always consistently delicious Pan-Asian fusion style ""japanese"" food. I've been there a few times and it's never disappointed. By far their best deal is the ""Sunda Social"" 4-6pm (I think) offer on weekdays where many of their appetizers/rolls are half off! A few favs: -Shishito peppers as a starter is always delicious. They're not too spicy and nicely charred. -Brussel Sprout salad is fantastic. -Oxtail Potstickers are delish -The Duck Hash is INCREDIBLE. One of the best things I've ever had. -The ""oh no you didn't ultimate handroll"", but ask them to make it into a regular cut roll. I think its their best roll next to the lobster and waygu roll. -Any of the tatakis are truffly and excellent. Service can be somewhat slow sometimes, but the ambiance of the place can't be beat.

I think I'd bump it up to 4 stars if they had indoor seating because it's a super cute place with decent (yet totally overpriced) food. We had 2 hot dogs, 2 fries, and 2 small drinks and it was over $15. And it's not even a whole side of fries- they just throw fries on TOP of your hot dog.

It is sooooooo loud In here!  We sat in back last time and did not experience the way too loud atmosphere like we did this time up front. To make matters worse, the table next to us would talk at each other even louder in an attempt to be heard over the rest of the place. On a Sundy morning after a night of drinking this atmosphere is unbearable. The food was ok but I remembered it being better when I was here last Time. I was sad because I was really looking forward to showing the place off to my friend but she hated the noise and was only somewhat happy with her food. She also never saw our server. The tables are so tightly packed that our ""big boned"" server could not fit between them to face us both when we ordered so my friend kept having to bend her head back awkwardly to face her if she wanted to feel like she wasnt playing a game of telephone.

Next up, I had this absolutely incredible vegetable and black bean caldo.  It seriously was one of the best things I've ever eaten!  It was a warm broth soup with potato-masa dumplings, zucchini, onions, woodland mushrooms, black beans, avocado and is topped with arugula.  Unbelievable!

From the quality and cooking of the food, ownership could have at least run to Jewel to get some groceries. The welcoming owner was obviously more interested in the next party instead of the one he was greeting. The woman wait staffer we had both times was detached. The starters were dull. The entrees, without exception from what I tasted, were without taste. Pork chops overhyped; blackened duck was sad. The desserts were rote and lacking in focus on details.

3293,HxaJvHF7DEJyQWgqY1Cmqg,"Ok, it's time to judge Crisp.  For a while, it was my favorite restaurant in the area.  I've been going for years.  I'm a Crispipster, been going before they got cool.   The summary - fried chicken is 5 stars, worth travelling for from all over the city (and maybe the burbs.) Bi bim bop is 3 stars, pretty good, but not worth travelling for. Everything else is average to below average, ignore it.  I understand the 5 star reviews for this place, but having lived a block away for years, I see their flaws as well.   Here's the run down.  But if you just want the fried chicken, you don't need to read any further, just go! Most importantly,  the fried chicken is 5 stars!  It's incredible, life changing, revelatory, all the sauces are good, and I have to keep myself from eating it on a weekly basis.  It may even be the reason all these Korean fast food places have opened up along broadway/clark in the wake of Crisp's opening.  Try every combination.  If you order it to go, get the sauce on the side or else your wings will be soggy by the time you get home-- but you have to ask for 2 sauce cups because otherwise they only give you one dinky little cup. Occasionally, they give you bad pieces or need to change their fryer oil, but this has only happened once or twice in the past few years...they will make good if you complain.  All this applies to the whole/half chicken and the wings only, not the strips/sandwiches. The bi-bim-bop is 3 stars.  Tasty and hearty, but very sweet and something about the way they cook their veggies makes them slightly slimy.  I can put it up with because they have a nice flavor, but any more slimy than they are and it would be too gross.  If you get an ala carte order of veggies, you'll notice this a lot more.  Too much oil?   Both varieties of kimchi are good.  If you haven't tried kimchi, try it, if not at Crisp than anywhere.  It's one of the world's healthiest foods.  It doesn't taste like it smells and will leave you feeling really good and healthy.  That stuff just gives me energy like Superman...I don't know if it's the spiciness or healthiness or what, but I've never felt better after eating something than after some kimchi.     Everything else?  Don't bother.  The chicken strips are always soggy.  The burritos are a sloppy mess of flavors that run into each other.  The chicken sandwich has an inexplicable slice of american cheese on it, to top off the soggy sandwich.   The fries are never cooked enough.  The fried mushrooms are mushy.  Noticing a theme?  I don't know what's up with that, but it's unpleasant when you get outside the fried chicken and bi bim bop.  I can't say it brings down my opinion of the place too much, as all I want from there is chicken/wings, but it would be nice to have options.     Customer service has always been weird at Crisp.  First, the bad.  They seem to hire fairly floaty and distant people.  Most of the time, it's just a funny quirk.  But the times I've gone during busy hours are the times I've had issues with my orders and they are noticeably flustered with a crowd.  A couple times the friendly, smiley, floaty person at front was quite obviously blazed.   From one smoker to another, I'm sorry if the owner reads this and gives you guys a talking to, but seriously- don't do that, it's really stupid and obvious.  So, whatever, they're figuring out the balance of responsible customer service and remaining hip, but they're still nice.  This is not an uncommon experience at these establishments in young neighborhoods and I've certainly seen worse.  It's just a bit awkward. BUT they are responsive when you point something out and will make good and apologize and all that good stuff.   On a stupid side note, whoever writes up the boards and names the food is kinda cheesy...all the food except the chicken has some corny name.  Just call it ""bi-bim-bop"" not ""bad boy buddha bowl.""  This is like that Simpsons episode where Marge's investment partners open up a pita place and give everything a cheesy Americanized name to cover up the country of origin. The prices increased with the popularity and the dinner meal deal is offered for less days during the week.  If the prices get any higher, it'll be officially too expensive to eat there often.  $10 after tax for 5 wings, though they are large wings, is pushing it (they were $7 or $8 a while ago.)   The lunch deal is good-- about $8 for 3 wings + fries + drink.  They don't officially offer a substitute for the fries, which is annoying because some employees let me switch them for something healthier, others don't.  After the wings, the last thing I want is a bunch of soggy fries, or any fries for that matter...too much fried stuff in one meal.  Some veggies or a small thing of kimchi would be nice. In conclusion, it might sound like I hate the place or something, but I just want to give a fair overview.  I want to emphasize that my criticisms should NOT discourage you from trying the chicken here.",N

17275,XlL9z4mAW-Hlq,"Wow!  First time here, but a great experience.  It is a bright, fun space.  My boyfriend and I started with a Sangria and Strawberry Rhubarb marg at the bar, both were great but we both ordered the latter for round 2. For dinner we split a cheese platter, mixto ceviche, and split the nicaraguan beef tenderloin.  The apps were delicious, but the beef was AMAZING.  They actually plated split portions for each of us, which were still quite big.  The meat was cooked perfectly and the truffled potatoes were fantastic.  I would have trouble trying anything else when I come back because this was so good.   We finished with the coconut cake - also delicious.  I ordered a cup of coffee with it, and that was the only thing that wasn't very good. Service was fine, nothing to rave or complain about.",N

40118,6WE9OLkO6lwbvxuSi8kg4g,"Indie was my third sushi experience.  I thought I hated sushi until I came to this place.  Apparently, all places were using unfresh fish and stringy nori.  I couldn't believe people at that stuff!  Then, I came here and I am a changed person.   Though, I feel sushi will be a taste I become accustomed to as I did with beer. Seaweed salad was a really fresh, and refreshing taste.  They serve it in a martini glass with an umbrella.   I don't remember the rolls we got, but I can say with full confidence that anything you order off the menu here will be delish.  It's BYOB and I swear, everytime we finished a bottle of wine and were moving towards our next, it was already uncorked--the waitress was that fast and attentive. The dessert menu was phenomenal.  Green tea ice cream was a bit of a bust, but the mango cheesecake was creamy, fruity, and fresh, and the mango sorbet was smooooooth.  Go with the mango!",N
27905,3zL3zBRlRS0bE6P-90-mew,"If you're expecting fine, upscale dining with pretentious and snooty ambiance, this is NOT the place for you. However, if you're looking for a cute, fun, and romantic time, this is definitely the right place. I've heard so many things about Geja's, and jumped all over the Groupon. The trick with Groupon is  to wait until most of the hype has died down, then go. Seriously. There is an expiration date, it's ok to be closer to the expiration than the purchase date. As luck would have it, this worked even MORE In my favor, as if used during the week, the Groupon was worth $60 instead of $50. Sweet. Armed with a $60 Groupon, my boyfriend and I headed to Geja's for our anniversary. After reading reviews, I sorta knew what to expect. Request a booth, you'll kinda smell like cooking oil, it's a little dark in here, careful of the hot oil, TONS of food, kinda pricey. Yep, all these things are true. But, oh man... this stuff is GOOD. It's not healthy, but it's just fun, tasty, and romantic. We opted for the International, which is $50/person. It included cheese at the start, beef, shrimp, and chicken for the main, and chocolate at the end. Everything was cut nicely, the meat good quality, and the service timed perfectly. Also sprang for a bottle of wine. They came around with a card for our ""special occasion"", and a coupon for next time. Needless to say, both of us left stuffed, happy, a little tipsy, and VERY satisfied.",N

However, I also remembered that I liked the place.  The lounge part anyways, I didn't try the food.  The bartenders were friendly, the drinks were strong (obviously!) and the crowd was pretty cool (mature, non-touristy, non-viagra-triangle-esque), and the space was great.  I didn't even know about this deck upstairs but I will definitely be back to check that out!",N

I've been there quite a bit recently, and their downstairs lounge, Curio, might be my new favorite place in Chicago.  The small room is lit largely (if not entirely) by candlelight, and the atmosphere is very dark and intimate.  They always have great music playing too!  I've only been during the week when it's been very quiet, but my friend was there this past Saturday and said it was packed (he said it was far less enjoyable).  I'll pass on Curio on a busy evening, but during the week, nothing beats a quiet night down there, enjoying a couple cocktails and talking to the very friendly (and talented) bartenders :)",N
23121,2IlUpsOMjDXnUenN,"Knowing there is usually a wait, we arrived at 3:00pm on a Saturday thinking we would be in between lunch & dinner & skip the lines. well not quite, we still waited 43 minutes. Congrats Rick Bayless for crowds all day long.  The lines did give me plenty of time to study the menu inside & out before I ordered. It is sort of a goofy system for ordering & sitting but what do I know. After our wait, we were given a number & then we ordered.  At that point we were directed to a table & waited for our food. It seems like the turn around could be quicker as there was a good deal of down time between our meal, dessert & hot chocolate. On to the important part, the food. We ordered The Saturday special sandwich of Goat Meat, the Veggie sandwich, a bowl of soup, 3 Churros, a cup of Hot Chocolate & 12oz. local Chicago beer for a total of $48. The soup was very rich & tasty with chunks of avocado, zucchini & potatao-maso dumpling. But the broth got a bit overpowering with what seemed like a salty beef bouillon taste about 1/2 way through. The sandwiches were very good as were the Churros. They have a corn tortilla taste to them but it works. I look forward to trying more of their food in the near future.",N

63541,7oDNdeDG4IahQizRNQBeTw,"Mercat a la Planxa is a great restaurant for a casual evening with a loved one or with a group of friends. The variety of tapas is similar to what you may have experienced at other tapas restaurants, but with a little upscale touch or twist to them.Upon arriving I was a little put off by the fact that some of the seats in the small entry-way bar were reserved. To my friends and I it was a little strange that there would actually be reserved seats in such a tiny space. Mercat a la Planxa has an extensive list of specialty cocktails as well as house-made sangria. We all opted for the sangria. It was good and multiples were ordered, but it was not outstanding. Having said that, at the time of our reservation we were escorted upstairs to the dining room which was like a breath of fresh air; two-story, lots of light and fun decor.At first, the menu can be a little intimidating even for someone who has had tapas many times before. Our waiter explained the menu to us and the layout of it made much more sense. The waitstaff was excellent, very attentive and more than willing to answer any questions that we had. I would describe the food as traditional tapas with a twist. An example would be that traditional bacon-wrapped dates are actually bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with almonds. This was definitely a favorite at our table. My table started off with approximately 4 -5 plates and kept one of our menus so that we could order more as we felt necessary. Our waiters recommended 3-4 plates per person and their recommendation was quite accurate. Please keep in mind that these are small plates. Some of them are much smaller than others. The pasta dishes are quite small.All of the food was delicious with a couple exceptions. Of course this is all based on individual taste. Presentation was excellent for all of the items we ordered as well as the items we saw arriving at other tables. One item that stood out as something that may need a little work was the walnut sorbet. After tasting it, I thought it tasted like something, but couldn't put my finger on it. My other half had the best description which I thought was incredibly accurate. They described the sorbet as tasting like Play-doh.My friends and I can't wait to go back to Mercat a la Planxa and try the many other items on the menu. We averaged approximately $60 per person for both food and drinks including tip. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great tapas and a good time.",Y

(1470 N Milwaukee Ave, Chicago 60622).  If you go between the hours of 10:30am-12:30pm be prepared to wait for at least 30 minutes or longer.  But I'm telling you... it's worth the wait IF you are a huge fan of breakfast. Favorite top two dishes from The Bongo Room: If you are feeling ravenous- order the Breakfast Burrito which has  a jalapeno tortilla with guacamole and scrambled eggs topped with melted cheese and sour cream, salsa on the side served with hash browns.  Might I mention,  I don't know where they get their salsa ingredients, but it's very fresh (every time).   And there is something about their hash browns too. Crispy, but not too crispy. Just love and I don't even need or want ketchup with them! If you crave hollandaise, the way I do from time to time... you should try the Eggs Benedict.  The eggs are cooked to perfection, the toasted English muffin provides a good base and I substitute the ham for spinach.  It's ooey, gooey, wonderful.    I'm a huge fan of Bongo Room.",N

17487,seOTkl99kzvmyZnv,"Totally mixed feelings on Violet Hour. Great food and drink, mediocre experience. I have a strict ""No Bars With a Line to Get In"" policy, which I was willing to break as I've been looking forward to checking out V.H. for quite a while; plus it was Saturday at 8:30, so what do you expect? That said, we were standing in line with some of the worst people you can imagine: some crone tried to bypass the line saying ""We're restaurant people, we won't take up a spot long""; one girl held the door open (letting cold into the warm waiting area) so she could chat with the guy she was there with who was still in line outside; another girl made a quasi-racist comment about the guy working the door; and four loud cougars from the 'burbs were carrying on at shrill tones that should be reserved for experimental music. Ugh. Willing to let all of that slide, as the hostess totally hooked us up on our request that she not seat the cougars next to the open table next to us. Thanks!!! I think V.H.'s seating system needs a little work. Our group of four ended up awkwardly arrayed with two couples in a booth that would have been better for a group of 6-8. While I was glad not to be in the line anymore, I was a little surprised we ended up in the booth given that the process of selecting groups of 2, 3 (3???), 4, 6, or 8 out of the line as seating became available seemed fairly regimented. The menu was superb. Love the arrangement by booze, descriptions, etc. that some people seem put off by. Loved getting to try rare gins (Genevieve's) that I haven't seen elsewhere. Love devilled eggs basted in brown butter with candied pork belly. Great waitress. Her recommendations were spot on, and she quickly and willingly replaced my friend's gin and tonic when it came out with flat tonic. But that begs the question how a hardcore cocktail lounge could end up serving a gin and tonic with flat tonic in the first place? Sharing is our caring, and our group passed each drink around for sampling -- I loved everything I tried. Complaints about too-sweet drinks seem a little oversnooty. I love to complain, so another word of complaint: when we ordered our first round, our waitress informed us that it would be fifteen minutes before the drinks came out. After forty-five minutes in line with a-holes, I was starting to get the shakes, so we decided to place our second round order when the drinks came. Strictly professional. Unfortunately, the second round (which seemed considerably more complicated in terms of required preparation) came out in five minutes, and since V.H.'s drinks are served in glasses plus a small vial of additional drink, our miniature table ended up packed full of glassware. The couple next to us bounced without finishing their tempura green beans, and offered them up to the girls next to us. I'd already been vulture-eyeing the beans when they arrived while the couple had been out for a smoke, and these girls were also cool with sharing, so we got us some beans and they were phenomenal. Order them beans when you go son! I will not go back on a weekend night.",N

54574,qfWtGJy3QuFvEbjOyZsk3Q,"This place is great.  My boyfriend and I were starving and really craved a good steak.  I remembered I had bookmarked this place and were outrageously happy I had.   At first we were seated relatively close to the door which offered a small draft, but asked to move and found a cozy little seat.  The lighting was just right and had had the same waitress that seated us, took our drinks, and served us.  She was sweet, Columbian, and honest with her recommended. We ordered the seafood platter for an appetizer and it was really fresh and delicious.  It was served with a mild and a hot salad/sauce called Chimichurri.  It was AMAZING!!! Next came the steak.  We got the Entrana, which was highly recommended.  It was served on a hot plate and sizzled when it came out.  It also came with a plantain, yucca, and a potato.   I can honestly say that the steak they served was the single most delicious hunk of meat I have ever had.  SO amazing.  I tried to eat the whole thing but just couldn't handle so much food.  I wish I hadn't gotten the appetizer.   I will be back as soon as possible.  They're BYOB, also, so I will bring my own wine! With two glasses of wine, 2 full dinners, and an appetizer for two, the bill was only $70 bucks.  Worth every penny!!!",N
37812,Ju2Pf44dRyd86m1DbtsEQQ,"I found this place thanks to Yelp, so first things first... thanks all!  :-) Okay, on with the review... I can't say I can compare this place to any other breakfast/brunch spot in Chicago as this is the only one I visited, but I can say my experience there was quite good.  The food is very fairly priced, the menu is extensive, and the taste was excellent.  The whole place seems to be staffed by college students, but they do a fairly good job of controlling the masses. My only mark against it would have be the absolutely staggering crowd, and associated wait times.  The waiting room on a Sunday morning around 11:30 was literally overflowing with people.  The poor folks plastered in the corner between the window and the wall probably had no prayer of hearing their names called by the attractive yet softspoken hostess.  Still, from what I've heard this is pretty much the case at any such establishment in Chicago, so I can't ding the place much for that. On a side note, for anyone planning on visiting the Field Museum or the Aquarium, Yolk is located a brief 10-minute walk away, just across the bridge leading to Museum Campus.",N

The cheesy deliciousness cannot be accurately described in words; it is truly something that has to be experienced firsthand. Once we arrived at the restaurant we were informed that there would be an hour wait which seemed a little confusing because there were lots of empty tables and this added to the all-around disgruntled feeing of the group but we decided to wait it out. The hostess staff at this particular location is not very pleasant but once we were seated our waitress was very nice. The wait was only 20 minutes or so. For the eight of us we ordered two large pizzas, one pepperoni and one sausage, and an appetizer sampler filled with an assortment of deep friend things. They call their pizza stuffed, not deep dish and it's more like a pie than a deep dish pizza. It tastes like a delicious gooey piece of lasagna with crust.

I ordered the BBQ bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. AMAZING. It really hit the spot. My husband ordered the philly cheese steak, which was also good, but not as good as my burger. Mmm I am drooling just thinking about it. HOWEVER. The woman who seemed to be the hostess/manager was extremely rude. First she seated us at a table by the door... which I thought was fine because, even though it was cold outside, there are two doors to the outside so there isn't a breeze when people come in. But my dining partners didn't want to sit by the door, so that's fine. When we asked to be moved to, she told us there weren't any other tables opening up. Fine. She then rudely told us once we were ""seated"" we couldn't move. Which I guess means once we got water and stuff we couldn't move to a different table? Ok, whatever, if that's their policy. A booth opened up a minute later, so we were able to move anyway. However, she struck again at the end of the meal, when we were chatting for about 10 minutes after we got our bill. She came over and actually asked us to leave! I mean, really? It's not like we were sitting there for hours reading books. This is a restaurant, not a fast food place. Yes, I understand there is a wait on a Friday night... and we waited for our table as well. But come on... it's just plain rude to ask a customer to leave their table. I waitressed for 10 years through high school and college, and although it's annoying to have your table occupied when there are customers waiting to be seated, you DEAL WITH IT. I have never asked a customer to get up. Just rude. Sure fire way to get someone to never return. By the way, our actual waiter was really nice... but I wonder if he put bitchy hostess up to this so we wouldn't cheap out on his tip.

2834,eNGjI-vhVh2vluMMPVzvTg,"Having recently moved to Chicago, I just had to visit Hot Doug's.  I saw this place profiled a couple of times on the Food Network.  This is beyond your average hot dog place.  Yes, you can get a basic hot dog for only $1.75 which has everything on it.  However, the real draw is the specialty encased meats that are a lot pricier, but you are paying for quality gourmet ingredients and friendly, efficient service.  I got the Stella Ackerman, today's special, which was a lamb sausage with spicy Moroccan mustard and shreds of Provolone cheese on top, a small order of fries, and a Doc Brown's cream soda.  Although I was starving when I got to Hot Doug's and waited in a long line (in the pouring rain!), the one sausage and fries were more than I really needed to eat.  My boyfriend got the White Wine and Dijon Rabbit Sausage with Fines Herbes Sauce Moutarde, Armagnac-Truffle Pâté and Truffle Balsamic Cream Drizzle.  Does that sound rich?  It is!  But it's totally worth it.  We will definitely be back in good or bad weather to try the duck fat fries and other specials of the week.  Our only mistake was that we didn't really split our sausages in half, because the rabbit sausage was very rich.  I just moved from San Francisco here and I think a place like this would do very well in the Bay Area with all its foodies and hipsters.",N

We got there and since our table wasn't ready yet, the owner, Tuan, is the cutest little man who quickly supplied us with water and two seats while we waited (maybe 5 minutes). We started with steamed chicken dumplings - which were amazing and so fresh. Then I had the beef fried rice which was DELICIOUS and a generous portion.

My girlfriend and I went last Sunday before a trip to the zoo. Parking is usually a nightmare (when the place was threatening to close the first time, part of the reason was they felt the lack of parking was hurting business), and we expected a wait, but we found a spot right away and were seated within two minutes. The place hadn't changed, right down to the trippy concert poster int he men's room. The menu was a little different, however -- I used to always come here for a burger, but my vegetarian girlfriend and my own increasing moral qualms about eating flesh prompted me to get the veggie burger, which I don't think they had last time. I got it made like a Grunt Burger, with fried onions and bleu cheese -- a good combo. Sadly, they no longer serve the Gourmet Burger, which featured a mushroom wine reduction sauce that I loved. The girlfriend got a portabello sandwich, which oddly tasted like a Whopper (a good thing). I like the homemade chips, but the portion of cole slaw is ludicrously small.   Chocolate malt for dessert, of course -- one easily feeds two. Oh, and we each had the temperature soup. Can't beat it for .52! Overall, it's probably nothing too special if you aren't going there to bask in childhood memories, but the food is good enough and the prices are decent -- our meal, soup, and malt came to less than $25.",N
2324,ZWJoLePkau60myUwU1hQCw,"So much has already been written about Hot Doug's, so I will keep this review brief. Simply said, Hot Doug's is one of the most charming (it's certainly the most hippest) hot dog restaurants in the city. And with a large menu of various dogs and sausages (even a vegetarian dog) complete with colorful ever changing names, you can be as adventurous you want to be. But don't worry, if all you want is a Chicago style hot dog, you won't be disappointed. My only complaint (other than the poor location) is that Hot Doug's is only open until 4pm. Also, you should be warned that if you make the trip out to Hot Doug's on the weekend (closed on Sundays) you will find yourself in a line that goes out the door and down the length of the building's side. Oh, it should also be noted that Doug (who takes your order) just might be the friendliest restaurant owner in Chicago.",N

27600,XmYFGIOe7bwxJWasCVslHw,"We headed back to Geja's for our annual trip for a night of sticking food into pots of warm liquids on Saturday (10/13/2007).  This time we brought my parents who, are more adventurous and will try anything once. So this wasn't a romantic night out but you know what, this place still rocks for a good time out of eating and talking with friends, family or loved ones. We had a reservation because we needed a table this time.  With MK in the 8th month of pregnancy, the booths don't cut it at any restaurant, let alone Geja's where they CAN be tight.  Additionally, my Dad doesn't do well with booths given his arthritis and his back.  Geja's were more than accommodating, given the few tables that they do have. We all went with the Premium Dinner service which includes your ""appetizer"" of the Gruyere cheese fondue, in which you dip an assortment of apples, bread, and grapes.  It's a good starter because if you've never ""fondue'd"" before it's easy to understand and you basically can practice what to do for the main course.  This was a good thing for my parents who admitted that they hadn't done fondue since ""the early 70's at best"". For the main course, we actually all ordered the same thing, the Beef Tenderloin with Chicken.  The more than ample platter of beef, chicken, potatoes, onions, peppers, mushrooms, and broccoli was delivered.  It can be quite intimidating but the waitstaff does a FANTASTIC job of explaining how long to cook things and how it all works.  My parents were really nervous about under cooking the chicken and so I think they didn't enjoy the chicken as much because they let it sit in the hot oil MUCH longer than they should have. But this is where my 4 stars is justified.  This time, the pieces of meat and chicken were extremely large.  I don't remember the pieces being that large.  They were so large that I actually would cut my chicken and beef before putting it into the oil.  To prove this point to myself prior to digging in, I took a hunk of chicken and put it in the oil for the 3 minutes the waiter said and it was still raw in the middle.  So I'm not sure if management of Geja's reads these, but you might want to rethink the size of at least the chicken hunks on the platters. This ONE thing aside, the meal was fantastic, my parents REALLY enjoyed it and we had a wonderful meal together.  Please don't get me wrong, my food was excellent and as usual I left here extremely full. The final course is the unbelievably fantastic Belgian chocolate fondue with orange liqueur.  You get to dip pineapple, melon, marsh mellows, pound cake and apple into this amazing dark chocolate.  There's ALWAYS room for this at the end of the night and it basically puts you over the edge on the full tummy scale. Everyone is describing the atmosphere accurately and on a weekend, they get crowded very very fast.  Reservations are mandatory here and if you're not there when they open (which is pretty early around 4:45), there probably is a wait.  This was my fifth trip here and MK and I try to make an annual pilgrimage. I believe they are in their 42nd year of service and that, my friends, is a true test of time in a city where restaurants come and go as quickly as Bears' QB's. ;-)",N
29284,RWZJe3w8DRXH6O1nj3PmMA,Great BYOB. We've been many times and are never disappointed. I take friends when they are in town when we want byob and a good value and they are always thoroughly satisfied. The Lemongrass chicken rocks!! And the spring rolls are so fun because you roll your own at the table. They have an avocado smoothy which sounds weird but is sooo tasty! Went with my girlfriend recently and they had a special 3 course menu. It was a great price so we went for it and ended up trying things we wouldn't have ordered. Lets just say the papaya salad knocked our socks off. So fresh tasting with shrimp and crisp veggies in a delicious sauce. Happy we branched out. The service is always great and the older man (pretty sure he is the owner) is so friendly and welcoming. Give it a try if you want great Vietnamese in Lincoln park. Or if you want a new BYOB place. Or if you have a large group and want something casual and fun.,N

My only complaint was that I was never told my sandwich came with chips and the clerk let me buy a bag in addition without mentioning it, which I thought was a bit ridiculous.  Maybe it was my fault for not noticing some sign somewhere, but it really subtracted from the experience as little annoyances tend to do.",N

The pork belly was pork fat, decent flavor if you could get past the mouth full of fat, which I couldn't. To top it off, our waitress couldn't be bothered with us. We had one drink that took about 15 minutes to arrive and she never came back for a second drink order. I could go on and on about how awful this is, but I think I've covered the key points - bad food and even worse service.  There are far too many incredible places in the city to give this a second try.

Nicely seasoned steak, spicy sauteed onions and peppers and a dollop of that guacamole served with fresh tortillas...Mmmmmm.

Irazu's eat-in cuisine is delicious and just like the food my mom used to make in Nicoya, Costa Rica.  Portion sizes are generous even though I smashed EVERYTHING on my plate.  You really won't want to stop eating even once you're full. With this experience in mind, I ordered from Irazu for a Lunch and Learn at work.  I figured they would be late because it's Tican Time - what do you expect, however they cut it waaay too close to the actual starting time of the presentation for comfort.  The sandwiches might have been good if they were hot (not completely their fault) and the chips with salsa were good. I was dissapointed in the meal, but everyone at work liked it.  The point is, eat in. You won't regret it! Pura Vida!",N

I would definitely come back!",N

The food is a combination of Korean with some American flavor. The Korean steak sandwich was amazing.

ANYWAY, now that I have been there once, i have been back 3 times :)   The food is awesome!  I got the veggie burrito and spinach cheese empanada - perfectly crisped tortilla stuffed with lettuce, rice, tomato, hot peppers, avocado, beans, sour cream, and I added spinach and zucchini (worth the extra $1).  It is super filling and healthy feeling all at the same time. Have enough people mentioned this... it is BYOB!  And the food is extremely authentic and affordable.  I really can't say enough good things about it.

53411,UZzz8uTxHx1tRRCNirSSbg,"Great food, great prices, and the first beer mimosa I've seen. The restaurant is a large, open room with communal tables and booths. The booths are each fitted with half-doors, creating a stagecoach look. I like that you can see what other people are having easily and, since it's a communal table, it's a lot more comfortable to ask someone what they are having than at most other places. The sausage dish I had was great and the portions are appropriately sized; I rarely clean my plate most places. My wife's and my only complaint was that her short ribs were burnt/charred partway through, which wasted part of the dish. Last week, The Publican made a list of the top ten new restaurants in America on http://Forbes.com - the only restaurant in Chicago to make the list, I believe.",N

44716,htx4RaH4yDfCREsrX4Bryw,"Bonsoiree is a B.Y.O.B. fine dining-ish restaurant that serves an 8 course and 13 course tasting menu for $95 and $150 respectively.  The food is part molecular gastronomy (I'm looking at you powdered octopus) and part modern haute cuisine (hello summer squash soup).  The menu is updated seasonally and features... wait for it... seasonally appropriate ingredients. Bonsoiree offers significant value for its price in that the food is masterfully prepared, beautifully presented, and the cumulation of the various dishes provides for a satisfying meal.  Additionally, the restaurant is attentively B.Y.O.B. (they open your wine and top you off, etc.). More importantly, the food is creative and fun.  I ate lobster ice cream, I had a conversation about cilantro gel, and I was pleasantly surprised by a soft boiled quail egg with horseradish.  The meal lasted around 2.5 hours for the 8 courses and it never felt tedious or boring. As evidenced in my 5 star endorsement, I would strongly recommend Bonsoiree.",N

54507,U0JgZ9mzaogdD0hR7mZvug,"Wow, those were some incredible Mojitos. I will update my review in copious detail when the hangover dissipates. Live music... go on  Thursday. I'm thinking some of the negative reviews are because the yelpster went on a Friday or a Saturday (busiest nights at any restaurant) with preposterously high expectations. Go on a weeknight- it'll be a favor for you, your date, the musicians, the server, the cooks all thank you for the gracious consideration with utter attention to detail. I mean really, on a quiet night have you ever encountered a burned entree? Thought not. Yum. The service was sublime, the Entraa (Highly recommended by the hostess, server, chef...)  Steak was transcendant, I kept stealing the avacado from my date's vegetarian plate and he in turn tried to swipe steak from mine. Ahem. Notice I say ""tried"" because 1. I didn't leave much 2. I hope his hand doesn't hurt too badly where the fork got him. I think it says something when a man is willing to be stabbed repeatedly with a fork in a vain attempt to obtain a scrap of buttery, juicy, succulent, perfectly medium rare meat from a girl who's cute but not too willing to share the yumminess. We enjoyed the Mojitos- lots of crushed mint, lime and sugar. I can't imagine what something so scrumptious wouldn't go with. Though I was told the Mango Mojitos were the most delicious- I couldn't say,  they were all out (they use fresh Mango, not the artificial stuff from a bottle or a powder packet). Next time, and there will be a next time... if PETA doesn't go after me for corrupting another vegetarian then stabbing him with a fork. (I paid for dinner. Does that make up for for my bad behavior?)",N

31691,CboBSwjjYmk-BMdnP1VIEw,"Opart sorta fell off my radar after a few mediocre meals there in the past, but I gave it another try last night to meet up with a couple of friends who love this place. Sometimes said friends and I agree ( M Henry) and sometimes I just have to question their tastebuds (Orange Garden). Opart has been in this same spot for years. It actually reminds me of the old days when I didn't have a life and I would get takeout from here and go next door and rent a movie from BP Video on a Saturday night. Thankfully times have changed. Opart has expanded their space quite a bit and the decor is downright upscale compared to its former self. I was pleasantly surprised at the surroundings. The menu is still as expansive as it was, with plenty of options for the neophyte Thai eater, or someone with a more advanced palate. We started with Tiger Cry, which is a marinated beef appetizer. The last time I had it, the meat was gross so I never ordered it again. It turns out that Opart change their meat supplier so my friends ordered it and I was curious if it had improved. It blew me away. It was so tender and flavorful; I couldn't believe this was the same dish from years ago. To that we also ordered a cucumber salad and crab rangoon, both of which were good, and on par with any better-than-average Thai restaurant. For entrees we chose pad prik (I firmly believe my friend ordered this just so she could say ""prik"" loudly) with beef, curry fried rice with pork, and pad si ew with chicken. Of the three, the pad prik was the best. We ordered it medium spicy and I was downing water like no other. Good stuff. The others were fine; I've had better, but I've certainly had worse. Service was good; this has also improved from what I experienced in the past. It's always nice to see a place that has made changes for the better. I'm glad my friends got me to give Opart another try. I will definitely be going back.",N

11295,hErI8v8XFlzTM2OU5nfWnw,"Piccolo Sogno means ""Little Dream.""  It was only fitting that we came for a late-night dinner after we watched Peter Pan at the nearby Tribune theater venue.       The bread service was decent, with a very nice house-EVOO.  The calamari was great - with a light and evenly coated breading - perfectly fried.  The squid-ink spaghetti had ample seafood flavors.  The pasta itself was hand-made: rustic in appearance and great in texture.  It was slightly overcooked, however.  The papparadelle with lamb meatballs was also great.  The meatballs had great flavors (enhanced by herbs).  The pasta was also handmade.  Very good.  Again, I just wish it was a bit more al dente.  Maybe my personal preference is more al dente than the average Americans, as my two dining companions were completely fine with the texture of the pasta (so take my words with a grain of salt).  The mushroom risotto was textbook execution - great consistency; ingredients were chopped so that they don't overpower the rice.  Unfortunately, the dish was a bit under-seasoned, and the giant slice of mushroom garnish was unnecessary.  The branzino sea bass was cooked whole.  The waiter brought it out and showed us, and then brought it back to the kitchen to de-bone and garnish.  It was cooked perfectly.  And the citrus flavor from the mandarin orange paired well with the fish.  I wish they de-boned the fish table-side, which would have provided a great show.  The dessert was great.  We got the tartufo with pistachio and white chocolate gelati.  The gelati had pronounced flavors (in fact it was the most intense pistachio flavor I've had in a gelato or ice cream), which contrasted well with the flavor and texture of the chocolate shell.  We also got a scoop of zabaione-flavor gelato - best flavor for a gelato, ever!   They have a well-balanced and affordable Italian wine list.  The waitstaff, without the help of a sommelier, was actually quite helpful in suggesting wine choices.  We got a bottle of 2007 Beretta Chianti Classico.  The well-placed tannin and fruit-forward (yet not cloyingly sweet or acidic) flavor made it a great companion to Italian food.   Service was friendly and helpful.  Decor was modern classy yet eclectic - reminded me of Violet Hour.  I liked the interior, but I can't help but feel that it was a mismatch with its food, which was on the rustic side.  They have a great al fresco space.  I will probably take advantage of that next time.   All in all, this was a great experience.  Other than the slightly overcooked pasta, everything was authentic-Italian.  I will be back for sure.",N

18485,HGHNoL-2HoMmrNlSOI6rbA,"Whoa, Babies everywhere at an Indian Restaurant? I didn't expect that. I guess it's the lunch buffet. Anyway, it was actually relatively quiet considering there were about three sets of babies, but that hasn't been my experience in most cases. I went for Lunch/Brunch and ordered the buffet. It had several dishes such as Salmon, Potatoes, and Chicken covered in a variety of sauces. Moreover, they even had a good sized desert buffet. The menu is huge and they seem to have several options (like the buffet) that are geared toward the more the casual Indian food connoisseur (with less spicy sauces). This is a great place to introduce someone to Indian food, as the food is tasty without being overwhelming. Service was good, but we did order a buffet, so there wasn't much to go on. Dishes aren't cheap, the buffet was $15 a person and the menu items were just under $20, but you can't really complain about $15 for all you can eat with a selection that size. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and will probably go back for the buffet at some point.",N

20666,hAIUBiO4SitbChUBqnc4ZQ,"Went here with a group of 8 on a Saturday night and they were able to accommodate us with very little advanced warning. The Gage is best described as an upscale gastro pub. Decent beer selection and a trendy cocktail menu accompany a menu that ranges from burgers to elk to steaks. I tried the pork chop and it was perfect at medium, nice and juicy. The mash potatoes are definitely a pass--certainly not worth the $4 for such a small portion of really average mash. Get the fries instead, they were delicious. The burgers all looked very good and at the price they're charging for they better be. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly and was able to handle our large party with no problems. The Gage may be a little expensive for what it is, but you are paying for that prime time Michigan Avenue real estate. I would definitely recommend The Gage for eaters in the downtown/touristy area, or as a spot for after work drinks with some coworkers.",N

I have three of my own, and I am the first to admit they have not always been the ""perfect angels"" at a restaurant, but I am attentive and take care of situations immediately. My kids also know how to behave in public, unlike some of these kids who are allowed to do ANYTHING they want. I hate to give a restaurant bad rating just because of it's patrons, but sheesh.....it seems to attract all the yuppies who have undisciplined children and they all come in with GIGANTIC strollers that take up space everywhere. I am also giving it just 3 stars because I have tried a couple different things off the menu and never cared for anything except the Red Eggs.
